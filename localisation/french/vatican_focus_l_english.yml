 VAT_ENG_revolution_eden:0 "§RThe British Church will start a coup, leading to a civil war. The existing government will form an authoritarian emergency state to defeat the Christians. The revolution is more likely to succeed if we are Protestant.§!"
 vatican_elagabalus:0 "§RThe minds of men are weak, fragile, maleable... even the wisest of mortals are reduced to animal instinct if you give them the chance. This operation would involve putting the French president in a particularly compromising position, then at the opportune moment, blackmailing him into ceding French territories.§!"
 vatican_inundatio:0 "§RMany thousands of Italians - men, women, and children - pray to God that they can escape the nightmare that we have inflicted upon their homeland. Countless people everyday try to flee the Kingdom, often at the cost of their lives. This operation would involve relocating thousands of migrants to the French border, then funneling them through key border points, creating chaos and confusion in the French state. If successful, it would be an ideal opportunity to strike.§!"
 french_collapse:0 "§RWhen the civil war ends, we will have an opportunity to make demands to the French state. If the communists win the civil war, France will be more likely to cave in to us.§!"
 vatican_corkscrew:0 "§ROn the outset of Spain's civil war, the Italian government was swift to occupy the Balearics to deny that the Republicans a foothold in the Mediterranean. Now the civil war is over, we are of course expected to return those territories... but who would stop us if we didn't?§!"
 vatican_marioneta:0 "§RSpain's new leader has quite a few qualms about the way we do things over here. It is an awful shame for neighbours to be so hostile. It would make things so much easier if they were to be... replaced.§!"
 vatican_depravity:0 "§RBy now, the stories of our atrocious and depraved behaviours have reached the ears of the British. They look on across their precious channel in horror and disgust at our deliciously tyrannical escapades, and they wait in fear, for they know what is to come. Our diplomats have devised a curious doctrine to take advantage of that fear and anxiety; we will openly declare our intent to invade them, our desire to see their churches burn and their values crumble. If our threats are strong enough, it could force those cowards to cave in to any demands we make...§!"
 vatican_benison:0 "§RThe Enlightenment reached as far north as Scotland in its day, inspiring great thinkers and writers of the Highlands to reinvent the way we all see the world. Of course, for others, this newfound liberty gave license to behave in the most repugnant, most violent, and most sexually depraved ways... That spirit, the soul of libertine Scotland, still exists up there somewhere. If we could just tap into it, the tearing asunder of His Majesty's United Kingdom would be sure to follow...§!"

#MILITARY FOCUS TREE
 VAT_grand_ambitions:0 "Grand Ambitions"
 VAT_grand_ambitions_desc:0 "If the Papacy is to survive in this rapidly changing world, it must first and foremost acknowledge that enemies lurk from all sides - we must never forget that the history of Christianity is a story of constant struggle."
 VAT_wargaming:0 "Wargaming"
 VAT_wargaming_desc:0 "With a force as inexperienced in warfare as the Paletine Guard, our only solution for now is to engage in a series of intense military exercises and wargames. Hopefully this will be enough to bring our military's standards up to a respectable quality."
 VAT_develop_the_palatine_guard:0 "Develop the Palatine Guard"
 VAT_develop_the_palatine_guard_desc:0 "Members of the esteemed Palatine Guard work part-time, they consist of a singular divison that was formed by Pope Pius IX almost a century ago, and they have seen no active service in combat. What the voices demand will be far from attainable as long as the Vatican maintains a force this small and inexperienced."
 VAT_expand_the_vatican_forces:0 "Expand the Swiss Guard"
 VAT_expand_the_vatican_forces_desc:0 "It is not enough to equip our divisions, we must train many more if the Vatican's defences are to hold out against enemy attack. The Pope must make a proclamation to the Christian world, a cry for any able-bodied man that still holds the gospels sacred to come to the city and pledge his life to defend it."
 VAT_study_foreign_designs:0 "Study Foreign Designs"
 VAT_study_foreign_designs_desc:0 "It is known far and wide that the Vatican library contain priceless knowledge and precious texts of antique origin, but one thing it most certaintly does not contain are the schema for constructing a heavy machine gun. It is time for us to employ the expertise of foreign manufacturers, to study their designs as intensely as the monk studies scripture."
 VAT_production_boost:0 "Production Standardisation"
 VAT_production_boost_desc:0 "Now that we have the knowledge to construct weapons, we must seek out the means - we must establish production lines as soon as possible and maintain a high level of manufacturing speed and quality."
 VAT_grounded_ambitions:0 "Grounded Ambitions"
 VAT_grounded_ambitions_desc:0 "Whatever our long term ambitions, there is no question that the Vatican City must first prioritise its defensive capabilities. Soon, the very sight of the Paletine forces standing proudly along the walls of the city will be enough to dissuade attackers."
 VAT_expand_foreign_cooperation:0 "Expand Foreign Cooperation"
 VAT_expand_foreign_cooperation_desc:0 "Our investigations into foreign technology designs have proven fruitful. It is an avenue worth developing if our lofty aims are to succeed."
 VAT_vatican_defence_array:0 "Construct the Vatican Defence Array"
 VAT_arditi_pontificia:0 "Arditi Pontificia"
 VAT_wielders_of_the_flaming_sword:0 "Wielders of the Flaming Sword"
 VAT_palatine_armoured_unit:0 "Palatine Armoured Units"
 VAT_papal_peacemakers:0 "Papal Peacemakers"
 VAT_mechanised_army_of_god:0 "A Mechanised Army of God"
 VAT_vatican_defence_array_desc:0 "A strong Papal Guard will only serve to defend us in short-term sieges. If the Vatican is to become a stronghold, we will need an advanced defensive array."
 VAT_mechanised_army_of_god_desc:0 "Our motorisation efforts cannot lose momentum. An army's strength is futile if it is not coupled with speed."
 VAT_wielders_of_the_flaming_sword_desc:0 "Just as God tasked the angels with defending the Gates of Eden with a mighty flaming sword, we will stand firm against any enemy."
 VAT_palatine_armoured_unit_desc:0 "Motorisation is just one step towards a glorious and unshakeable military force. Since the Great War, armour has become increasingly vital in warfare and so we must adapt to survive."
 VAT_papal_peacemakers_desc:0 "Our armoured technology remains far behind that of our foes. However, our advantage is that foreign designs can be copied and altered to suit our needs, we are not starting from scratch. Soon, tank divisions bearing our insignia will be rolling across the fields of Europe."
 VAT_arditi_pontificia_desc:0 "An army capable of a broad range of operations is invaluable to us, but as time goes on, we will need to create specialised divisions."


#INDUSTRIAL / AIR / NAVY FOCUS TREE
 VAT_rapid_modernisation:0 "Rapid Modernisation"
 VAT_rapid_modernisation_desc:0 "The task set before us is a mighty one - just as the terrifying Goliath towered over David, we find ourselves dwarfed by the prospect of modernising this ancient institution. Not only must the Vatican heave itself into the twentieth century, it must grow to compete with those that would seek to destroy it."
 VAT_establish_an_engineering_commission:0 "Establish an Engineering Commission"
 VAT_establish_an_engineering_commission_desc:0 "When faced with such an enormous challenge, the delegation of tasks is essential. A central commission tasked with designing and maintaining the city state's production processes will ensure far greater efficiency."
 VAT_expand_offensive_capabilities:0 "Expand Offensive Capabilities"
 VAT_expand_offensive_capabilities_desc:0 "God created the land, and Man went on to conquer it - God created the ocean, and Man went on to sail it - God created the heavens, and for countless generations, it was a domain out of reach. No more. Some within the Pontificate's inner circle distrust such technology, but we ultimately have no choice - to defeat our foes, we must use their machines against them."
 VAT_motorise_the_guard:0 "Motorise the Guard"
 VAT_motorise_the_guard_desc:0 "The Great War taught us many terrible lessons. Among them, that the age of the soldier on horseback is swiftly coming to its close. If the Palatine Guard is to truly modernise, it must be able to mobilise with the same swiftness as our enemies."
 VAT_maximise_production_efficiency:0 "Maximise Production Efficiency"
 VAT_maximise_production_efficiency_desc:0 "The voices grow louder with each passing day, and they warn that our time is growing thin. Our resources are limited enough as it is - we must produce equipment with greater efficiency."
 VAT_establish_the_pontifical_academy:0 "Establish the Pontifical Academy"
 VAT_establish_the_pontifical_academy_desc:0 "The Vatican is not an entirely antiquarian institution - it once hosted a grand academy, a place of reason and experimentaton, led by the legendary Galileo Galilei. The Pontifical Academy sadly faded into history, but now the Pope shows interest in reviving it. Only by observing and understanding the works of creation in minute detail may we truly come to understand the majesty of God."
 VAT_invite_foreign_experts:0 "Invite Foreign Experts"
 VAT_invite_foreign_experts_desc:0 "An academy of science is nothing without lively debate - Pius XI intends to reach out to institutions the world over, to spread the word of the Vatican's scientific contributions and to invite experts to the city for a chance to share their own."
 VAT_embrace_modern_technology:0 "Embrace Modern Technology"
 VAT_embrace_modern_technology_desc:0 "The machine age is slowly giving way to the age of electronics as the first computers make their debut. Where lightning had once been considered the domain of the divine, mankind now wields the power to breathe electrical life into his creations."
 VAT_improve_amenities:0 "Improve Amenities"
 VAT_improve_amenities_desc:0 "The Sistine Chapel has stood as an icon of church power for many centuries, the symbolic centre of Papal rule and the functionary centre of the Vatican. A careful balance must be maintained between reworking these medieval buildings for new purposes and respecting their age-old meaning."
 VAT_palatine_armaments:0 "Palatine Armaments"
 VAT_palatine_armaments_desc:0 "If the Paletine Guard is to grow into a Papal army, a steady supply of arms will be vital. The Vatican was never intended to function as an armaments producer, but Pius XI grows increasingly enthusiastic about it - the voices instruct us to prepare for war."
 VAT_expand_arms_manufacturing:0 "Expand Arms Manufacturing"
 VAT_expand_arms_manufacturing_desc:0 "The voices have taken on a more viscious tone as of late. They grow impatient with us, and so the Pope has ordered increased production. In hushed conversations in dark corners of the city, cardinals wonder if he is losing his mind."
 VAT_reorganise_italian_industry:0 "Reorganise Italian Industry"
 VAT_computational_innovation:0 "Computational Innovation"
 VAT_develop_papal_colonies:0 "Develop Papal Colonies"
 VAT_restructure_italian_universities:0 "Restructure Italian Universities"

 VAT_heaven_and_sea:0 "Masters of Heaven and Sea"
 VAT_revive_the_marina_pontificia:0 "Revive the Marina Pontificia"
 VAT_secure_trade_routes:0 "Secure Mediterranean Trade Routes"
 VAT_una_nuova_capitana:0 "Una Nuova Capitana"
 VAT_mare_nostrum_policy:0 "Mare Nostrum Policy"
 VAT_marina_subnautico:0 "Marina Subnautico"
 VAT_overseas_combat:0 "Overseas Combat"
 VAT_integrate_italian_production_lines_desc:0 "Now that Italian territories are under our command, we have inherited a powerful military industrial complex."
 VAT_reorganise_italian_industry_desc:0 "Our population has increased a hundred-fold since our conquest of Italy, and our exploits further afield will be futile if we cannot even feed our own people. We must swiftly move to reboot the Italian consumer industry and reopen factories across the peninsula."
 VAT_restructure_italian_universities_desc:0 "With Itally finally under our control, and a thriving industrial complex at our disposal, we must now move towards the world of academia. These are dark times for the Church, secularists and atheists infest the educational institutions of the land. School syllabuses will require massive restructuring if we are to have a faithful and devout population."
 VAT_develop_papal_colonies_desc:0 "After our seizure of Italian lands, we inherited a modest albeit invaluable African empire. While Islam remains the dominant faith in some of these regions, and despite Mussolini's failure to develop colonial infrastructure, we still have a lot to gain from our overseas lands. We will make loyal and productive subjects out of them yet."
 VAT_computational_innovation_desc:0 "As the march of technological innovation continues on, so must we. The Vatican cannot afford to lag behind its neighbours any longer. We must become a centre, a capital, of electronic and computational research."
 VAT_ground_support_efforts_desc:0 "As our air capabilities expand, we must ensure that it works effectively in coordination with ground forces, serving not only to dominate the air but to assist in any and all conflicts down below."
 VAT_dominate_skies_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate reality of war that bombs must fall and cities must burn. The Lord found no enjoyment from the justifiable destruction of Sodom, reigning hellfire upon that damnable hive of sin, yet he did not falter. He did not hesitate. He had an obligation, and in his infinite wisdom, the Lord fulfilled it."
 VAT_heavens_shield_program_desc:0 "Possessing a level of industrial and technological might that we could have only dreamed of years before, now is the time to truly reinvent warfare. The latest innovations in rocketry have the potential to transform humanity for the better, but they also reveal a deeper and darker power, one that will change the world forever."
 VAT_angels_wept_desc:0 "No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man."
 VAT_corpo_aero_militare_desc:0 "The Papal States was truly a force to be reckoned with in its day, the mouthpiece and the mighty hand of the medieval Catholic Church. One power it did not possess, however, was the ability to fly like the angels in heaven, to swoop, dive, and soar through the clouds. That is soon to change. The Vatican has convinced some of the best Italian aerial experts to support our research, and so our ranks grow."
 VAT_angels_death_desc:0 "Scripture tells us that whenever the angels revealed themselves to mere mortal men, the first thing they would say was 'be not afraid'... our enemies shall soon learn that our metal angels are not so gentle."
 VAT_palatine_aerial_supremacy_desc:0 "Our enemies had a strong headstart when it came to air warfare, and so we will need every advantage we can get. We may not have the largest airforce on Earth, but our pilots shall be the greatest this world has ever known."
 VAT_heaven_and_sea_desc:0 "Our military and every division within it must function in unison, not as seperate units, and so an airforce that supports our naval endeavours will be invaluable."
 VAT_revive_the_marina_pontificia_desc:0 "Since the Middle Ages, the Papal States have possessed a small but vicious naval force, one to rival any invading barbarians. Times change however, and the last Papal vessel was sold off during the pontificacy of Leo XIII. As we find ourselves yet again in possession of a coastline, the time may just have arrived to revive our old naval ambitions."
 VAT_una_nuova_capitana_desc:0 "At the Battle of Lepanto in anno Domini 1571, the Papal States fought a fierce Ottoman navy and emerged victorious. The flagship of that day, the Capitana, has long since been destroyed, but that spirit of victory shall live on in our new fleet forever."
 VAT_mare_nostrum_policy_desc:0 "The Romans once dominated the Mediterranean just as they dominated the land, and their name for it - 'Mare Nostum' - 'Our Sea' - reflected the unwavering belief that it would always remain that way. Rome may be long gone, but Mare Nostrum will live on in our ambitions to make this sea our dominion."
 VAT_marina_subnautico_desc:0 "The original Marina Pontificia may have been a force to be reckoned with, but one thing it did not boast was a fleet of u-boats. Perhaps if they did, history would have turned out slightly differently."
 VAT_secure_trade_routes_desc:0 "With a thriving domestic industry within our reach, we must also ensure to maintain strong relations with our neighbours. Mussolini's Italy pursued a policy of autarchism but it will be a long time before our economy can enjoy something similar."
 VAT_overseas_combat_desc:0 "As time goes on, we will no doubt find ourselves in conflict with powers overseas. In such eventualities, our naval invasion capabilities must be without flaw."
 VAT_INTEGRATE_ITA:0 "Integrate the Peninsula"
 VAT_INTEGRATE_ITA_desc:0 "Now that our strength on the peninsula has been solidified, the time has come to fully incorporate Italian territories. We cannot hope to expand until these lands are firmly in our grip, ensuring the survival of our nation for generations."


#POLITICAL FOCUS TREE
 VAT_invisionsofthenight:0 "In Visions of the Night..."
 VAT_invisionsofthenight_desc:0 "The time is near. Great thunderclouds wrap the heavens and the Earth in their electric embrace as we prepare to harken the truth. A revelation this night is nye... and whatever it brings, everything is sure to change. Change utterly."
 VAT_dinner_with_mussolini:0 "Dinner with Mussolini"
 VAT_dinner_with_mussolini_desc:0 "As the Voices fester night by night, swirling in the dreams of Pope Pius XI, it is clear we must set into motion our schemes of conquest. Violent action is far too risky – instead we will seek an audience with the tyrant of Rome, the Nero who fancies himself Caesar. He knows that the Church is still a fixture in the lives of many Italians, and he relies on our blessing for his rule to remain stable."
 VAT_the_voices:0 "The Voices"
 VAT_the_voices_desc:0 "In his dreams, Pope Pius XI hears ethereal noises, voices on the wind. Sometimes they are quiet, sounding of harsh coals crackling, and other times of dissonant trumpets, and sometimes they merge into a chorus. In the cacophony, he has been able to make out one consistent instruction, one singular command: to restore what is rightfully ours – to revive the glorious Papal States."
 VAT_the_civitavecchia_conference:0 "The Civitavecchia Concordat"
 VAT_the_civitavecchia_conference_desc:0 "We have gained enough leverage with the Italian regime to start making some demands. If the Voices are to be satisfied, there is no question that the Vatican must expand beyond the constraining walls of the city, to become a true nation-state."
 VAT_denounce_tyranny:0 "Denounce Tyranny"
 VAT_denounce_tyranny_desc:0 "The Vatican stood by in horror as the clerical orders of Mexico, Spain, and the Soviet Union were oppressed and dismantled, millions of Christians left spiritually homeless. As we witness the grip of anti-clericalism and fascist tyranny wrap around Italy, we know we cannot stand by any longer. The Pope will make an address to the world denouncing these tyrants before it is too late."
 VAT_the_grosseto_conference:0 "The Livorno Concordat"
 VAT_the_grosseto_conference_desc:0 "Our momentum builds, and our influence grows, and with it we must expand further. We cannot allow time to slip away, and the Voices have begun intruding into the Pope’s waking thoughts. Something big is coming."
 VAT_the_two_romes_pact:0 "The Two Romes Pact"
 VAT_the_two_romes_pact_desc:0 "We have done it. The Vatican and Rome: the two cities have become equally synonymous with power and prestige on the peninsula. With our leverage over the dictator next door, and wielding the support of the people, it is time to enforce a treaty that enshrines the Pope’s position as equal to Il Duce."
 VAT_promote_clerical_fascism:0 "Promote Clerical Fascism"
 VAT_promote_clerical_fascism_desc:0 "Italy, like much of Europe, moves at frightening speed towards a tyrannical ideology. One that insists upon the might of men, the greatness of modern technology, and dismisses the power of God. Through public addresses and tours of the country, His Holiness will work with this trend rather than fight against it – he will mould Italian fascism to place the Church at the centre."
 VAT_pius_the_great:0 "Pius the Great"
 VAT_pius_the_great_desc:0 "Our efforts to promote a fascism that serves the Church have been a success! The people increasingly look to His Holiness for guidance, just as it was in ages past, and we must take advantage of this swiftly. The Pope shall be the most respected leader in Europe."
 VAT_radicalise_the_masses:0 "Radicalise the Masses"
 VAT_radicalise_the_masses_desc:0 "The Voices grow more intense – they demand we work faster. As the Italian shadow looms ever larger on our horizon, the Pope has insisted that we move quickly to build our forces and to rally the public’s support. The Papal States cannot be restored without regime change on the Italian peninsula; the people will be radicalised through more public sermons, radio broadcasts, and publications."
 VAT_pacellisstatevisit:0 "Pacelli's State Visit"
 VAT_pacellisstatevisit_desc:0 "As part of our efforts to extend a hand to the world, legitimising the Vatican State in the process, we must strengthen our ties with the United States. Eugenio Pacelli, a close associate of Pius XI, shall go there himself to meet with lawmakers, diplomats, and the American public."
 VAT_declare_the_papal_states:0 "Declare the Papal States"
 VAT_declare_the_papal_states_desc:0 "The Voices are louder than ever before – His Holiness hears them always! We must move quickly to declare the Papal States and to achieve our final destiny. Oh, what glories must await us – oh, what wonderful plans the Voices must have in mind!"
 VAT_tothecityandtheworld:0 ""To the City and the World...""
 VAT_tothecityandtheworld_desc:0 "With Italy firmly in the grasp of the Pope, the Papal States are almost in reach. As the Voices cry out, louder than ever before, Pope Pius XI must speak directly to the people, to ready them for the coming change!"
 VAT_despose_il_duce:0 "Depose Il Duce"
 VAT_despose_il_duce_desc:0 "The dictator of Italy has fulfilled his usefulness to us. True, he has been a loyal ally, but there can only be one king in the end, and that is the King of Man. We will strike a deal with the elites of Rome and depose this brute before he gets any notions about who is really in charge here."
 VAT_embrace_political_refugees:0 "Embrace Political Refugees"
 VAT_embrace_political_refugees_desc:0 "Our denouncement of tyranny has been met with much praise from the democracies of the world, and those fleeing oppression now look to us for hope. We must swing the doors of the Vatican open to any and all who seek refuge from fascistic persecution. It is a risky thing to do, but no less essential if we are to live up to the teachings of Jesus Christ."
 VAT_secure_armaments:0 "Secure Armaments"
 VAT_secure_armaments_desc:0 "As we prepare to secure our place on the peninsula, to restore the Papal States to glory, there is no question that we must be prepared to fight. Blood and bullets are the way of fascists – it is only with blood and bullets that they can be destroyed. Through the purchase of sophisticated weaponry, our revolution may well succeed."
 VAT_the_papal_revolution:0 "The Papal Revolution"
 VAT_the_papal_revolution_desc:0 "This is it – months of preparation have all amounted to this moment. With the support of the Italian Catholic population, with the determination and willingness to succeed, and by the grace of God the Father, our mission, our crusade, will be a victory. It must be. The Voices demand it."
 VAT_incite_the_fear_of_god:0 "Incite the Fear of God"
 VAT_incite_the_fear_of_god_desc:0 "Our war has rallied men and women across the peninsula, a glorious effort that is sure to please to Lord! There is no time to waste, we must maintain this momentum and remind the people of what they are fighting for. There is no encouragement quite like the promise of salvation… and the threat of eternal hellfire."
 VAT_restore_order:0 "Restore Order"
 VAT_restore_order_desc:0 "The Italians are one people, destined for great things by the blessing of God. Let us put this terrible war behind us and unite under the banner of the Church once and for all."
 VAT_fromabove:0 "... From Above"
 VAT_fromabove_desc:0 "Oh glory! We see you coming on the clouds of Heaven, Lord! Pray, bring us salvation from Satan’s wrath!"
 VAT_frombelow:0 "... From Below"
 VAT_frombelow_desc:0 "..."
 VAT_embraceearthlydelights:0 "Embrace Earthly Delights"
 VAT_embraceearthlydelights_desc:0 "At the very instant that Eve partook of the Forbidden Fruit, all those eons ago, God’s plan became a failure. At that moment, Man and Woman chose their destiny, they chose to align with the forces of sin. Oh, the Lord tried to fight it. Did he not destroy Sodom? Lay waste to Gomorrah? Topple the Tower of Babel? Impressive feats, but they served only to postpone the inevitable."
 VAT_invokeinfernalwrath:0 "Invoke Infernal Wrath\n§RCOMING SOON§!"
 VAT_invokeinfernalwrath_desc:0 "The forces of darkness delighted in infecting the mind of the Pope, controlling the old man like a puppet on a string. What a fine irony that the Lord’s representative on Earth became Lucifer’s greatest asset. The machinations of Hell move towards a single goal now; to destroy everything that God so adores. Mankind will suffer forever."
 VAT_unleashthefinaljudgement:0 "Unleash the Judgement\n§RCOMING SOON§!"
 VAT_unleashthefinaljudgement_desc:0 "Hark! The trumpets sound! The strength of the Papacy has grown to a fever pitch and His Holiness did well to follow the commands of the angels. His time is over now, however, and he will be judged fairly in the next life. As for the rest of humanity... they have deviated greatly from the path that God laid out for them. The time for fun and games is over, as the children of the Earth shall soon learn."
 VAT_forgeaneweden:0 "Forge a New Eden"
 VAT_forgeaneweden_desc:0 "In the centuries since his death, Christ has witnessed from the heavens a humanity devoid of hope, warmth, and love. War and inequality still ravage the world, the machines of the battlefield lay waste to all in the crosshairs. Truly, the Earth is no place for weak and tender ones as it was in the time of Eden. That era is over. As promised by God, the meek shall inherit the Earth."

 VAT_look_west_desc:0 "Since the Great Schism, western Christianity has emerged as the largest school of Christian thought on Earth, far superceding its eastern counterpart. Some of the mightiest nations in the world are either Catholic or Protestant, and so it is westward that we must turn."
 VAT_look_east_desc:0 "West and east have drifted further apart for generations, and the western churches have enjoyed unrivaled supremacy over the centuries. Meanwhile, the eastern Orthodox faith has suffered through Muslim incursions and communist purges, pushed to the very edge of the Christian world. To be truly Christian is to struggle, to fight everyday for one's beliefs, and so it is to the east that the Son shall turn."
 VAT_BOOST_SUPPLY_and_RESOURCES_desc:0 "Christ indeed knows struggle and uncertainty, having lived his previous life under constant persecution. Without a place to lay his head, he developed a special sympathy for those without home or hearth, and so our first perogative is to accomodate the most needy within society."
 VAT_BOOST_RECOVERY_and_COST_FOR_SUPPORT_desc:0 "In his lifetime, Christ performed a total of thirty-seven miracles, among which was the astonishing Feeding of the Multitude. Let the people feast upon bread and fish provided by the state, let their bellies be full so that they may work hard - let no man or woman go hungry ever again."
 VAT_BOOST_ECONOMY_and_REPAIR_SPEED_desc:0 "For too long has Italian society been stratified between rich and poor, have and have-not. The accumulation of meaningless wealth has for centuries distracted the people from what truly matters, the nourishment of their eternal soul, and so we will begin the arduous process of eliminating money altogether. Ours will be a society wealthier than any in history, rich with spiritual fulfillment."
 VAT_BOOST_MANPOWER_and_STABILITY_desc:0 "If the Lord had intended for some men to be higher than others, He would not have moulded all of them in His own divine image. This new kingdom  will be the first of its kind since Eden, one where Man and Woman, white and black, and those of all sexualities will live in absolute harmony. The road ahead will be rugged and strewn with sharp stones, but persist we must, and endure we shall."
 VAT_BOOST_DEM_SUPPORT_and_STABILITY_desc:0 "As we move towards a new Eden, a glorious purpose that drives us all forward, His Majesty the Son of Man shall hold a grand Mass for the whole nation and the world. His voice shall be carried on every airwave, his words will be read in every newspaper, his message shall inspire a generation."
 VAT_INFLUENCE_EAST_desc:0 "With Orthodox faithful scatterd throughout the eastern world, our first mission is to contact them. Their influence in governments throughout these lands, however small it may be, will help us to soften up potential allies and enemies."
 VAT_ALLY_GRE_desc:0 "The Orthodox faith remains strong in the Hellenic Republic, and as one of our closest neighbours, it is to them that we must first turn."
 VAT_WAR_YUG_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is a nation divided in every respect, a stable mess that teeters persistently on the edge of civil war. It is a situation we can take advantage of if we move quickly. The eastern provinces are home to a significant Orthodox population; perhaps the time has come to liberate them."
 VAT_YUG_CORES_desc:0 "Just as western Christians have bickered and split into countless factions over time, the Orthodox faith too has no single ideology. Turkey, Serbia, Russia - the list of Patriachates goes on ad nauseam. Our mission to save humanity shall never succeed in full if we cannot unite the Orthodox peoples."
 VAT_ANNEX_GRE_desc:0 "There was a time, long ago, when Greece and Italy were one, united under God. The Byzantine Empire may have fallen to Ottoman invasion, its last little provinces eaten up centuries ago, but the echoes of its existence live on into modernity. Our union with Greece on this day will be remembered for eons as the first brave steps towards a Byzantine restoration."
 VAT_INVITE_BUL_ALB_desc:0 "While some of our Balkan neighbours are still opposed to democratic reform, they have moved increasingly closer to us in recent months. Our efforts to influence them have garnered much success and now might be the time for us to suggest a closer union."
 VAT_TUR_UNREST_desc:0 "Byzantium died a death of a thousand cuts, and it was the Ottomans that made the final killing blow. On that dark day in 1453, it must have felt as though the world was ending, that no hope remained for Orthodox Christians. However, not all glories are meant to last and with the fall of the Ottomans only decades ago, we may finally have an opportunity to reclaim the holy city of Constantinople."
 VAT_TUR_WAR_desc:0 "A coordinated coup across the Turkish state is too much of a risk, failure is far too likely. Therefore, we have no other choice but to go in, to reclaim the great city of Constantinople after centuries of unjust Muslim control. Just as the fall of the city marked an end to the Medieval era, its reclamation shall bring a new age, an age everlasting."
 VAT_SOV_WAR_desc:0 "Communist rule, first under Lenin, and now under the red tyrant Stalin, has been nothing short of catastrophe for Russian Orthodoxy. Bishops have been imprisoned, exiled, and even murdered for their beliefs, and these proud men have gone down as martyrs. It is time we fulfilled their brave legacy, to restore Russia to its natural form, and to bring glory back to the Russian Patriachate."
 VAT_DEMAND_HOLY_LAND_desc:0 "It is a tragedy and a disgrace that the holy territories in the east, the Lands of Milk and Honey, remain firmly in foreign hands. The secular empires of Britain and France pay little heed to this land's importance, and so it is only right that it is returned to us."
 VAT_CRUSADE_desc:0 "Our divine ambitions stretch beyond former Byzantine lands. In time, all shall call themselves Orthodox Christian."
 VAT_SOUTH_SPA_WAR_desc:0 "There was a time when Byzantium had a small foothold in south Iberia. It could have been the beginning of expansion into western Europe, but alas these territories were lost. Spain's recent turmoil has made them weak, and so we may have an opportunity to restore past glory."
 VAT_ROM_ALLY_desc:0 "Romania remains one of the most devout Orthodox nations in eastern Europe, and the Patriarch holds significant sway in political affairs. They would serve as a valuable ally, particularly against Soviet aggression, but if they refuse our offer, we may have to resort to desperate measures."
 VAT_BYZANTIUM_desc:0 "'Consider then, my brothers and comrades in arms, how the commemoration of our death, our memory, fame and freedom can be rendered eternal.' These were the final words of the final speech of the final Emperor in the final days of the Byzantine Empire. What we are about to declare was never thought possible by the enemies of God. But the Lord is patient, and Byzantium rises again."
 VAT_REACH_OUT_TO_ALLIES_desc:0 "We cannot afford to make any errors, and we will need the very strongest allies in the wars to come. For this reason, we will send diplomats to Paris and London with haste."
 VAT_ALLY_AUSTRIA_desc:0 "As the German Reich expands and consumes all in its path, it seems ever more unlikely that the so-called 'Allies' intend to do anything about it. With Hitler turning his terrible gaze towards Czechoslovakia in recent times, we must move quickly to secure an alliance."
 VAT_HOLY_ENTENTE_desc:0 "The Allies cannot be trusted to defend Christian democratic ideals - the time has arrived for an alliance of nations that truly hold dear these sacred beliefs."
 VAT_REBOOT_THE_COUNTERREFORMATION_desc:0 "The spiritual revolution brought on by figures like Calvin or Luther have done more damage to the cohesion of Christendom than anything in history. The Son laments the needless division of his followers into sects, each bickering over minor details and petty distractions. Under the doctrines of Catholicism, there will be once again a single Christianity and a single congregation of men."
 VAT_STRIP_THE_ALTARS_desc:0 "Catholicism has deviated the masses away from the true meaning of Christ's teachings - we shall do away with such disgraceful things as Papal infallibility and idol worship. Our kingdom, if it is to embody the real essence of God, will be one of plain and simple devotion."
 VAT_CATHOLIC_UPRISING_desc:0 "Our efforts to achieve a pan-European Protestant dominion have incurred widespread Catholic unrest. The Son believes that he can convert them in time, but for now we must move to suppress the more extremist Catholic militias."
 VAT_JOIN_ALLIES_desc:0 "Without hesitation we must request to join the Allied faction. As Germany expands by the day, there is no telling where they will strike next."
 VAT_PREPARE_WAR_desc:0 "Tyrants come and go, taking all that they can and leaving nothing in return. The Christians and Jews of Germany cry out for a saviour, for an end to Hitler's reign, and we are obliged to answer."
 VAT_RESTORE_CHURCH_IN_ALLIES_desc:0 "Britain and France have proven useful allies so far, but we can never consider these colonisers truly righteous until their churches have been restored to full power."
 VAT_ALLIES_REVOLUTION_desc:0 "The great Carolingian Empire, the torchbearer of western Christianity after the fall of Rome, was dominated by a people called the Franks. Their kingdom was a beacon of holy enlightenment in a sea of heretical principalities, and it is a shame that their descendants, the French, have completely abandoned their pious heritage. Without a second more to lose, the Frankish Kingdom must rise again!"
 VAT_ALLIES_REVOLUTION_ENG_desc:0 "Our British brothers have become disenfranchised in a state where church power wanes by the day and Christianity has truly been torn asunder between Anglican and Catholic believers. The time is now to ignite the fire of revolution and restore the British Isles to their rightful place as strong, Christian lands, united and proud."
 VAT_WAR_ALLIES_desc:0 "The time has come to face the colonial power to the west head on, to bring the evil empire of France to its knees and restore them to a former Christian glory that they forgot long ago."
 VAT_CAROLINGIAN_LEGACY_desc:0 "The Carolingian Dynasty ruled a domain stretching from Catalonia to Holland; from Brittany to Croatia. It was a flicker of light in the depths of the Dark Ages, a monumental achievement that was only accomplished through devotion to God. Indeed, the empire was so pious as to be nicknamed 'Imperium Christianum', and in time, it evolved into the glorious Holy Roman Empire."
 VAT_WAR_SPA_desc:0 "The Carolingian Empire once ruled portions of northern Spain, and on our quest to Christianise the world, it gives us the perfect casus belli to restore Spain to her former piousness."
 VAT_RESTORE_TO_GLORY_desc:0 "The lands of Switzerland and the Benelux were once firmly under Carolingian rule. It is only right that it becomes that way once more, such is the wish of His Majesty the Son of Man."
 VAT_OUR_HINTERLAND_desc:0 "The Carolingians once ruled tributaries as far away as modern Yugoslavia, and so it is to eastern Europe that we now turn."
 VAT_spread_christianity_desc:0 "The restoration of our glorious imperium, a bulwark against any and all secularist tyranny, was but the first step in a long line of glories. There will come a day when all principalities under the sun worship the same Father and pay allegience to the same Son of Man."
 VAT_AUDIENCE_IN_THE_ROSE_GARDEN_desc:0 "The United States is a nation divided, socially, racially, and theologically, with a diverse plethora of Christian sects spanning from coast to coast. The Son's emergence on the world stage has heightened tensions between these groups, and so the president has invited us to attend the White House to remind American Christians what truly unites them; devotion to Christ."
 VAT_LESSER_EVILS_desc:0 "If our ambitions to unite Christendom with the restoration of the Carolingian Empire are to be realised, we must shift our focus towards West and East Francia - France and Germany. Once a united kingdom under Charlemagne, these rival nations will only threaten our existence for as long as they remain independent."
 VAT_THE_FINAL_CRUSADE_desc:0 "For centuries, Christian soldiers dedicated to the task of retrieving the Holy Land braved the elements of the Middle East, driven forward by the promise of eternal salvation in the next life. It was the hope - the quest - of Pope after Pope, and yet, this noble goal was never permanently achieved. With the Son risen again, it is time to revive that old dream of the Church, and to realise it."
 VAT_monasteries_desc:0 "Since the days of the Enlightenment, we have witnessed a striking collapse in the number of men joining the monastic orders, or women joining the sisterhoods. Abbeys have gone to ruin, left in decay, but the keen diligence of the scribe in his chambers, quill in hand, cannot be allowed to vanish. We shall go about reestablishing the lost orders, and in time, those monasteries of old will see life again."

 VAT_HARMONY_desc:0 "Our vision of a harmonious Earth, one where the pleasures and dreams of Man go unhindered by senseless hierarchies, shall require unholy levels of preparation. We cannot simply do away with all sense of law; such a world would inevitably collapse into tribalism and tyranny. Therefore, our garden of delights will strike a cautious balance between self-fulfillment and societal cohesion."
 VAT_NO_GODS_NO_MASTERS_desc:0 "God pursued a rigid philosophy of social order at the expense of liberty - hardly a bargain. If we are to fully realise the aspiration of a neo-edenic garden of delights, spanning the face of the Earth, we must do away with all authoritative institutions of the past. Law, order, decency, morality; such things will be mere suggestions from this point forward."
 VAT_SPA_DELIGHTS_desc:0 "The Spanish Enlightenment promised untold freedoms to the people of Iberia, but the movement remained largely relegated to the upper echelons of society. The elite of the day were careful not to let it go 'too far,' instead cultivating a kind of 'enlightened despotism' - a laughable contradiction in terms. Spain will soon know the true meaning of enlightenment."
 VAT_FRA_DELIGHTS_desc:0 "The pursuits of French Enlightenment thinkers, from the innovative statesman to the psychopathic writer, sent the French Republic down a path of uncontrolled and uncontested authoritarianism. Justice became the falling blade of the guillotine, and celebration swiftly devolved into subjugation. With history as our guide, we will not allow the same to happen again... if we can avoid it."
 VAT_ENG_DELIGHTS_desc:0 "While some wielded the revelations of the Enlightenment with wisdom, forging revolutionary states, there were others who took a darker path. To younger gentlemen in the British aristocracy, the Enlightenment gave license to all manner of drunkeness, lawlessness, and sexual deviancy. They founded secret societies where all kinds of detestable acts would go unpunished... ah, the good old days."
 VAT_ITALIAN_STABILITY_desc:0 "There are those witihn our ranks that pant and gnash at the thought of outward expansion. All in good time - first, we must ensure the peninsula is under our heel."
 VAT_CRACKDOWN_ON_CATHOLICS_desc:0 "Our recent acquisition of Spanish territories has gone down less than palatably among the devout Catholics of Iberia; they are relics of bygone years who still cling to foolish spiritual tradition. The Enlightenment may have normalised 'freedom of religion', but we must go further and pursue a kind of hyper-secularism to eliminate dissent altogether. There is only one god now, and She is Pleasure."
 VAT_PORTUGAL_desc:0 "In 1755, the city of Lisbon was shaken to its foundations by a terrible earthquake. The tremors were enough to reshape Portuguese society for decades. It came in the midst of the Enlightenment, and spurred furious debate over the existence of a wrathful God - today, we will send a different kind of shockwave throughout Portugal. One that will put religious debates to bed once and for all."
 VAT_PUNISH_PARIS_desc:0 "Most of the French State collapsed to us without a fight, horrified at the mere sight of our monstrous hordes. Paris and its environs, however, continues to be a centre of rebellious action. It is time for their insolence to be drowned out."
 VAT_LOW_COUNTRIES_desc:0 "Enlightened concepts of liberty and equality are only a passing thought in our Benelux neighbours, second to the pursuit of wealth and power. The people shall cheer for us when we end the tyranny of the minority and bring true freedom to the low countries."
 VAT_HELLFIRE_CLUBS_desc:0 "The Hellfire Clubs that emerged from the debauchery of the British elite served a special kind of gentleman; the kind who boasted high status, devilish imagination, and ungodly amounts of freetime. Our Hellfire Clubs will function as church-like havens of devotion to the most sickening communal acts. No longer will such clubs linger in dark corners; we will construct grand cathedrals in their honour!"
 VAT_CONSOLIDATE_THE_ISLES_desc:0 "The Hellfire fad had a moment in Ireland long ago, popularised by the infamous Richard Parsons, a madman who spent his freetime praising Satan, drinking himself into a coma, and stripping nude in the presence of clergy just to see their reaction. In other words, he is precisely the kind of man we need in times like these!"
# VAT_WAR_CANADA_desc:0 ""
# VAT_ATLANTIC_OFFENSIVE_desc:0 ""
# VAT_NORTHERN_OFFENSIVE_desc:0 ""
 VAT_WAR_USA_desc:0 "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - these promises formed the bedrock of the United States of America. It is tragedy that a nation so capable of ascending to enlightenment has never truly lived up to those ideals. Perhaps, just perhaps, if we were to reboot that revolutionary spirit, to ignite the flame of the American Enlightenment, it could open the door to global rebirth."
 VAT_WAR_GER_DEL_desc:0 "If the beautiful machine is to be a centrepiece of our twisted revolution, we will need the industry to out-produce all foes. If we allow the German military industrial complex to keep growing unfettered, our aspiration will became an impossibility."
 VAT_INTIMIDATE_CARDINALS_desc:0 "Understandably, many cardinals of the old Vatican order have some... issues with the way we do things. Rumours abound that a Catholic revolution stirs in the shadows, so we will have to get creative with how we acquire intel."
 VAT_PACELLI_desc:0 "It is troubling to say the least that in the fragile early days of our glorious regime, one of the Vatican's most esteemed cardinals is nowhere to be seen. What is he up to? There is no question that Pacelli needs to be restrained before he causes any trouble."
 VAT_INCORPORATE_COMMUNISM_desc:0 "The Soviets in the east came so close to enlightened revelation - we both agree that the church ought to be wiped from the face of the Earth. But in the place of one totalitarian ideology, Stalin has installed another. Nevertheless, 'communism' bears striking similarities to the goals we seek to accomplish, and so we will incorporate it as we continue to nation-build."
 VAT_TOWARDS_A_NEW_HARMONY_desc:0 "As we delve deeper into the ideals of communism, we have been inspired by the works of utopianists like Charles Fourier. His vision of a 'Harmonian Earth', a world where communal living, social interaction, and the pursuit of pleasures takes precedence. Indeed, the collective love and unity of humanity in this new, more perfect Eden will have the power to reshape nature herself."
 VAT_HIJACK_SCRIPTURE_desc:0 "It is hardly in our interest to allow the gospels to circulate any longer, but we are forced to acknowledge that Christianity has burrowed itself like a tapeworm into the fabric of human civilisation, feasting on the peoples' insecurities and ignorance, leeching on their potential. It would be a shame to waste such an apparatus of social control, and so we will edit the gospels for our own ends."
 VAT_ALTER_HUMANITY_desc:0 "The unityism of humanity cannot be accomplished through psychology alone; Man's physical form too must be repurposed. This new body will be perfectly adapted to a very specific kind of communal lifestyle, and little else. It will mean that any potential for society to change in the future will be eliminated, but why on Earth would they want it to after harmony has been achieved?"
 VAT_PHALANXES_desc:0 "Utopianists of the past have often espoused the notion of communal cities, plantations on which hundreds of humans live and work together in peace. It is time to construct the first of these, gigantic complexes designed around fraternal existence, pleasure-making, and self-fulfilment. Thus, the smoggy urbanscapes of yesteryear will be abandoned and left to rot as the corpse of the old world crumbles."
 VAT_ANTILIONS_desc:0 "Our alterations to humankind have thus far proven incredibly effective! We cannot stop here, not when we have the momentum - we shall expand transformative operations to other species, and soon, the natural order itself will bend to our will."
 VAT_CONGREGATION_desc:0 "Where once they were made in his image, the transfiguration of Man has almost completely disconnected humanity from their creator. He would not recognise them now that they have become truly harmonian; the final operation now looms."
 VAT_MILITARISE_PHALANXES_desc:0 "There are those within and without our shining communal cities who would see our entire social project crumble. We must affix the very latest in defensive technologies to our communal complexes, preventing any and all from getting in... or, indeed, getting out."
 VAT_HARMONIA_desc:0 "The path to unityism is an ongoing process, one that may never truly end, but it is certain to become humanity's destiny now. We established the infrastructure for an eternal Eden in Man's image, destroying all trace of the world that came before, thus eliminating any potential for mankind to ever return to the way things were. Nothing shall be the same again."
 VAT_ANTI_SCHEDULES_desc:0 "As our struggle to retain control worsens by the day, we must employ unconventional tactics to assuage rebel forces. Everyday, every meeting and social event we conduct will be entirely impromptu; in fact we shall do away with timekeeping altogether. It will become impossible to analyse our movements for any kind of pattern, weakening rebel efforts considerably."
 VAT_SADISM_desc:0 "The sadistic ideas of perhaps the great Enlightenment thinker of his day, the Marquis de Sade, shall serve as a guiding star not only for how we organise this civilisation but also for how we destroy all others. Our military training will increasingly centre around the beauty of war, the sheer sensual joy of inflicting pain on the enemy. Soon, the people will cry out for conquest!"
 VAT_PUBLIC_NUDITY_desc:0 "The irony in normalising every taboo under the sun is that humanity must first return to its pre-Fall incarnation. To encourage and even enforce public nudity will ensure our domination over the aspects of everyday life that humankind takes for granted. It will also serve as a first step towards more the normalisation of more... intimidate social interactions."
 VAT_ENSLAVEMENT_desc:0 "It would a tragic waste of human life to conduct a mass execution of all those opposed to our ideology. If the Christians are so eager to serve a power higher than themselves, then let us become their new god. In a society where all pleasures are catered for and all luxuries are at hand, there will always have to be an underclass working tirelessly to maintain it."
 VAT_HEDONISM_desc:0 "To hell with notions of 'efficiency' and 'restraint,' we want a society of gluttons and pigs! Theft will no longer be the crime that God believed it to be, exquisite foods and public banquets will become the norm, and our soldiers shall gain a reputation as barbaric plunderers and pillagers!"
 VAT_ALLURE_OF_THE_MACHINE_desc:0 "To build a world where the pursuit of ever more excessive and bizarre pleasures is the goal of life, we must embrace every facet of modern technology. It is technology that has thus far pushed humanity into the realm of prosperity - we need push it only a little further to discover the truly depraved potential of machines."
 VAT_MASOCHISM_desc:0 "An army that enjoys inflicting pain is a foe to be reckoned with - an army that enjoys receiving it is impenetrable. Our enemies will not know what to do when every single tactic they employ results in nothing but pleasure for us. To train an army of men in this fashion, however, will require months, even years, of intense exposure therapy to the most ungodly horrors of war."
 VAT_NEONSPIRAL_desc:0 "Society truly has changed in rapid and dramatic fashion since its ascent to a sado-masochistic lifestyle. However, doubts still remain about the most intense of taboos, and there is no room for doubt in our new order. The very architecture around us, from the roads to the classrooms, must be demolished and reborn in an image that inspires unrelenting excess."
 VAT_ROBOFUCK_desc:0 "As unrestricted innovation cements itself as a cornerstone of our modern libertine agenda, some have begun to wonder why we cannot pursue the ultimate taboo - the destruction of the sacred concept of humanity itself. Perhaps the only way to reach ultimate pleasure is to merge with the machines, to redesign our bodies and minds so that even the thought of restraint becomes impossible."
 VAT_120_DAYS_desc:0 "Are not laws dangerous which inhibit the passions? Compare the centuries of anarchy with those of the strongest legalism in any country you like and you will see that it is only when the laws are silent that the greatest actions appear."
 VAT_Corbetts_Vision_desc:0 "The imaginings of the utopianists who promulgated the literary scene of the nineteenth century had countless wonderous ideas, and it was inevitable that, from this hopeful tradition, dreams of women's suffrage would emerge. Sadly, the grand societies depicted by authors like Elizabeth Corbett, lands where women ruled supreme, have never come to fruition... perhaps that is about to change."
 VAT_Amazonian_Dream_desc:0 "Corbett's vision of a utopian “New Amazonia,” a land where men are mere servants and women wield unimaginable technological power, serves quite nicely as a blueprint for Lilith's mighty plan. Ours will not just be a society of feminine empowerment, however; it must pursue brutal suppression, avid militarism, and occult practice if it is to survive and thrive in a man's world."
 VAT_Womans_Best_Friend_desc:0 "As our empire grows stronger, so too do our warriors. Trained for combat, and exposed to all manner of elixir and intoxicant, we push the boundaries of humanity ever further, no longer bound by God's design. Our latest experiments involve the absorption of life itself, draining the souls of creatures to allow our women to live for centuries. It would seem that dog is not just Man's best friend..."
 VAT_REANIMATION_desc:0 "Though our plans are ambitious, the Prince believes that we are not yet ready to pursue them. First, we will have to master both the sciences and the dark arts, combining them to forge an unstoppable army. To this end, so-called resurrectionists, madmen who fall somewhere between scientific genius and Satanic priest, shall be given licence to experiment beyond all bounds of ethics or morality."
