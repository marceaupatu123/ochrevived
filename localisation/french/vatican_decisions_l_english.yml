 VAT_CATEGORY_CHRISTIAN_WORLD:0 "Unite the Faithful Few"
 VAT_CATEGORY_CHRISTIAN_WORLD_desc:0 "The power of love in our hearts may be without limit, but the Son's strength on Earth is very much diminished. Centuries of gradual secularisation, ideological diversification, and misinformation has led to a modern world in which few recall, or indeed care at all about, the Word of the Son of Man. It is imperative that we unite those few who still do - all the principalities of the world are sinful in their own ways, even those whose leaders worship Christ, but in these dark and trying times, we cannot be picky."

Valiant soldiers, descendants of those who never know defeat, make your way to the Holy Sepulchre and tear the Holy Land from the grasp of this abominable nation.”\n\n- Pope Urban II, 1095 AD (at the Council of Clermont whereupon he proclaimed the First Crusade)"
