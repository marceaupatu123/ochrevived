 lateran_treaty:0 "Lateran Pacts"
 lateran_treaty_desc:0 "In February 1929, the “Roman Question” as to the extent of the Pope's temporal powers was settled when the Italian government agreed to recognise the full sovereignty of the Vatican City State. Apart from achieving independence, the Vatican has also been granted financial compensation for the loss of territory that formally constituted the Papal States. With the rise of fascism in Italy, however, a secular ideology espousing violent action and the might of mortal men, can Rome be trusted to maintain peaceful relations forever?"
 seeking_recognition:0 "Seeking Recognition"
 seeking_recognition_desc:0 "As a young city state, the Vatican has yet to achieve full recognition from all nations. In the years following the Lateran Treaty, the Pope has earnestly sent diplomats to all four corners of the world - the great powers of the Earth must be made to realise that the Papacy is not the fading echo of a lost age, and that Christ's teachings remain the only path to salvation."
 archaic_institution:0 "Archaic Institution"
 archaic_institution_desc:0 "Dating back nearly two millenia, the Catholic Church has undergone many changes, having risen to be one of the world's foremost spiritual authorities. From Emperor Constantine's conversion to the establishment and gradual expansion of the Papal States, it is clear that the Church has played a pivotal role in the affairs of Europe and beyond. However, the Enlightenment threw that pretige into question, forming the bedrock for liberal democracy; communist revolutions sweeping the world threaten the wealth and status of the Church; and a new religious order now lurks in the heart of Europe, one that espouses the might of the state, the beauty of machines, and the death of God. There is no question of it: the Papacy must change or perish."

 production_standardisation_desc:0 "If the Vatican's defences are to stand a chance against outside threats, modernisation and a standardised method of production are essential."

 grounded_ambitions_idea_desc:0 "Whatever our long term ambitions, there is no question that the Vatican City must first prioritise its defensive capabilities."
 grand_ambitions_idea:0 "Grand Ambitions"
 grand_ambitions_idea_desc:0 "If the Papacy is to survive in this rapidly changing world, it must first and foremost acknowledge that enemies lurk from all sides - we must never forget that the history of Christianity is a story of constant struggle."

 engineering_commission:0 "Papal Engineering Commission"
 engineering_commission_desc:0 "A central commission tasked with designing and maintaining the city state's production processes will ensure far greater efficiency - his Holiness the Pope cannot be expected to do all the work."

 maximise_production_efficiency_idea_desc:0 "Our resources are limited, and our time is wearing thin - the voices demand that we speed up our efforts!"

 pius_the_great_idea:0 "Divine Right"
 pius_the_great_idea_desc:0 "In bygone days, the authority of the Pope was unquestioned, superceding that of any king. In our struggle to secure control of the peninsula, the Italian people must again believe in that sacred authority."
 safe_haven:0 "Safe Haven"
 safe_haven_desc:0 "It is not enough to hold extravagent dinners with the leaders of the free world and pay lip service to their ideals - the Papacy must act! From far and wide, those fleeing political upheaval and persecution are welcome to seek refuge within these ancient walls."
 fear_of_god:0 "Fear of God"
 fear_of_god_desc:0 "It is now or never! The faithful men and women of Italy will fight valiantly for the church when we strike the fear of the Father into their hearts."
