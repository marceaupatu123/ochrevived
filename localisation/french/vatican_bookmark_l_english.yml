 VAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In this age, the supremacy of Pope Pius XI is but a mere shadow of his predecessors'. Once master of the Papal States, the Pope now lays claim to a measly 44 hectares.

Our prestige is whittled by the day, from accusations of inaction after the Ethiopian invasion, to deafening cries for reform.\n\nTo make matters worse, His Holiness is in a state of delirium, ceaseless and unearthly Voices swirling in his head. Concerns grow over whether these Voices will be our downfall... or perhaps, could they be our salvation?"
