# WORLD NEWS #
 cloudnews.1.d:0 "The news has spread far and wide by now, people the world over have awoken to a stunning revelation. The moment that Christ, our heavenly saviour, returned shall surely be remembered as the greatest moment in history – and we had the privilege of witnessing it! Without a second thought, the Vatican has handed all authority over to the Son of Man. The hearts of millions have been lifted high by a voice, carried via radio waves, that feels familiar and yet so divine. The Son promises salvation, a new world in which all are forgiven. Glory be! A new Eden for all!"
 cloudnews.6.d:0 "When the Lord appeared to John all those centuries ago, he promised a day of reckoning. The day and time of the Great Judgement was only ever known to the Father, predicted by many but all proved to be false. That day – on which the sun turns dark and the thunder clouds bellow, the trumpets of apocalypse screeching with a worldwide fury – has finally come. Each of us expects salvation, but the truth is that we all have sinned. We are at His mercy now..."
 cloudnews.7.d:0 "How was it fair, pray tell, for the Lord in all His wisdom to manifest the Tree of Knowledge in that damnable garden only for him to forbid the sweet taste of its fruit? A fool could have predicted the outcome. Today, the forces of Hell began waging a war of total destruction upon the Kingdom of Heaven above, and thanks to the Pope’s... cooperation... the Prince of Hell has finally manifested on the Earth. He offers a deal: all who align with him shall reap the rewards of a new reality, one where the Devil rules absolutely, one where “restraint” and “law” have been done away with. An Earthly Paradise this way comes, a universe shaped in Satan’s image, and humanity’s sinful nature shall finally take form."
 cloudnews.8.d:0 "The heavens blaze with a brilliant orange light, every star and planet in the sky wrapped in flames. This moment was inevitable. Earlier this morning, the forces of Hell led by Lucifer himself broke out of their restraints and converged on the angels in Heaven – a terrible, brutal, and bloody war ensues. They have been planning this for a thousand years and word has it that God himself has fled his throne! Make no mistake about it: humanity represents the ultimate threat to Satan, they are the greatest manifestation of God’s power, love, and hope. That dark Beast has plans to reshape Creation in its entirety and all of God’s works, including Mankind, are doomed to be destroyed."

#Vatican#
 vatican.21.d:0 "Ambrogio awakes with a start, his body hot and trembling. He reaches to take a sip from the glass of water at his bedside. The room is still – the Voices have stopped. It has been weeks since he heard them first, they were subtle enough in the beginning. Now, he hears them every night, in every single dream. Their origin is unknown to him but he is convinced they are divine. When they speak, they blend together in a noise so indiscernible as to be inhuman. In the cacophony, he has only ever been able to make one thing out. A command: to re-establish the Papal States and once again project the Papacy’s influence across all of Italy. It is a seemingly impossible task as Mussolini’s regime grows in power every single day. But if these words truly are of heavenly origin – if, for the first time in his long life, the Pope is finally hearing the very voice of God – how can he refuse?"
 vatican.22.d:0 "A special meeting has been arranged with Il Duce himself, the dictator of the Italian Kingdom. In all his time in power, Mussolini has not met the Pope very often, but this is a very special occasion. If we are to begin projecting power across the peninsula once more, just as we did all those centuries ago, we will need to employ a little... persuasion. Benito Mussolini knows he needs the church’s blessing to keep his regime stable, the Italian people have not yet forgotten the Word of God. If all goes well tonight, this could end up being quite a lucrative relationship for both Rome and the Vatican. At least for now."
 vatican.23.d:0 "It is not unusual for the Papacy to get a word in on political affairs, and there is no better occasion on which to speak out than now. This afternoon, the Vatican published a forceful essay, penned by His Holiness, titled ‘With Burning Concern’. Among many things, it condemns the idolisation of the state promoted by Hitler’s regime and by extension all of fascist ideology. The neopagan, ultranationalist, and white supremacist views of a growing proportion of Europeans flies in the face of everything that Christ taught us. The distribution of the essay to churches across Germany has been done in secret, but we fear that Gestapo raids are imminent. It is, however, just a first step in our mission to fight tyranny and project Papal power once more."
 vatican.26.d:0 "“Today,” he began, raising his arms to the tens of thousands watching from below, “Italy is one people under God! Our way of life is governed by scripture! Our values and dreams are inspired by the divine! Nevermore shall the Italian people suffer beneath the boot of tyranny – let us rise...”\nThen he began to falter. The Pope choked up for a moment, and at first, the crowd thought he had been overcome by emotion.\n“Let... us...”\nThen he stumbled, and then he collapsed. Cries rang out and aides rushed to assist him.\nThe Voices. They never stopped. In fact, they have only gotten worse. Pope Pius XI rests softly now in his chambers, physicians attending to him as he drifts in and out of consciousness. In those brief waking moments, his words are as incoherent as the Voices that babble in his mind. Just as glory seemed to have been achieved, fate chose to shock the world. There is only one question on everyone’s lips at this moment..."
 vatican.27.d:0 "It began with a wisp of white smoke, trailing out of the mouth of Pius. The sight bewildered his doctors, they were overcome with wonder. Within minutes, clouds that glowed bright and smelled of sweet candles had encapsulated the room and were flooding down the stairs. The entire Vatican City was soon filled with a dreamy light, but the cardinals that witnessed it felt no fear. Many rushed to the source, bursting into the Pope’s chambers to witness the grand miracle – where Pius XI had once lay was now a figure, wreathed in light, gazing back at them."
 vatican.28.d:0 "It began with a stream of black smoke, rising out of the mouth of Pius. The sight stunned his doctors, they were overcome with horror. Within minutes, plumes that burst with hot sparks and left everything they touched stained black had encapsulated the room and were seeping down the stairs. Cries rang out in the night as the entire Vatican City, its centuries-old steeples and frantically screaming cardinals, rose up in hellish flames. One brave priest covered his mouth with a handkerchief and stormed up to the source of the fire. Bursting into the raging room, his skin blistering in the heat, the man was stunned by what he saw. The body was as black as coal, wrapped in red and amber flames – it was sitting upright, its hollowed eyes gaping wide, staring back at him."
 vatican.33.d:0 "Our efforts to conquer the peninsula have not gone unnoticed by the dictator in Germany. He has sent troops to depose us and rescue Italian fascism – right when our destiny was at hand! We have the option to keep fighting, but our revolution is fragile. We may have to seek an agreement of some kind..."
 EdenDiplo.8.d:0 "Mere months after the historical restoration of the Carolingian Empire, the Son of Man has announced a grand council, to be held over seven days, in the German city of Worms. Alongside representatives from all the Carolingian provinces, we have been invited to negotiate the future of Europe. Imperial diplomats have made the case that our territory historically belongs within the empire, and it is now up to us to decide the fate of our people." 
 vatican.41.d:0 "While we gather our strength, terrible enemies loom to our north. One, a once great Christian empire that has lost sight of its heritage, proporting to be free and democratic while subjugating colonies the world over. The other, an imperium bent on the complete elimination of the Jewish people and the destruction of Christ's legacy. Just as Moses secured the freedom of the Jews all those centuries ago, we now must act.\n\nThere remain a handful of faithful Christians in France and Germany, clergy we could align with and, when the time comes, rely on to assist us in overthrowing these terrible regimes. However, our resources are limited and we can only afford to invest fully in communications with one or the other, the Church of France or the Church of Germany. We must select wisely, and have the determination to fulfil Man's destiny no matter the cost; only then can Christendom be reborn."
 vatican.64.d:0 "The recent regime change that the Papal States has undergone has left much to be desired by the international community. The careful diplomatic exchanges of past years have been reversed in an instant, and it would appear that we are now wholly without a friend in the world."
 vatican.70.d:0 "It would appear that our recent 'negotiations' with the French president have, despite his best efforts, led to all out civil war in the country. We could always sit back and watch, their suffering becoming our amusement, or we could use this as an opportunity."
 vatican.71.d:0 "At last the French state has restored some semblance of order, and with the country so bitterly divided and scattered with smoking ruins, we can finally strike."
 vatican.72.d:0 "With the French regime now entirely under our control, Europe does not stand a chance."
 vatican.73.d:0 "Despite this weakened state, the French have stood tall and refused to submit to our glorious imperial ambitions."
 DelightDiplo.1.d:0 "In an unlikely turn of events, the frightful [VAT.GetLeader] has invited president [Root.GetLeader] to Salò, Lombardy, for a no-expense-spared night of a lifetime. A mass gathering of Italian politicians, clergy, and aristocrats where every and all pleasures, however perverted, will be fulfilled. The invite was delivered, of course, in secret. While the sexual deviency of the Kingdom next door is already known worldwide, the president's darker side has become intrigued. The news of this trip would likely never become public; then again, can [Root.GetLeader] truly spend a night of sin with the Devil himself?"
 DelightDiplo.2.d:0 "In a frightful, albeit perhaps predictable, development, the foul [VAT.GetLeader] has sent several copies of incriminating photographs to the president's office. No one, not the media, nor even the president's own cabinet, has received these photos... yet. They came with a simple message: the Devil demands several southern and colonial French territories within the next forty-eight hours, or every French newspaper and radio station, along with every member of parliament, will receive these photographs."
 DelightDiplo.3.d:0 "Our civil war may finally be at an end but a certain [VAT.GetLeader] has chosen this moment to strike. He demands our complete submission to the Kingdom, our precious liberty eliminated. What can we possibly say to this?"
 DelightDiplo.4.d:0 "In recent days, more and more frightened, hungry migrants have fled from Italian territories to escape the perverse [VAT.GetLeader]'s regime. Our sympathies are with these poor Italian men, women, and children, but their numbers have become too much for us to handle. Some have begun to wonder whether this was a deliberate move by the devils nextdoor to confuse and weaken us."
 DelightDiplo.5.d:0 "At the instant that the Spanish civil war began, Benito Mussolini seized the Balearic Islands to ensure fascist control of the western Mediterranean. Now that our war is over, we of course expected the current Italian regime to hand over control of the isles - instead, they have insisted on retaining control indefinitely!"
 DelightDiplo.6.d:0 "In an unlikely turn of events, the mysterious [VAT.GetLeader] has invited [Root.GetLeader] to the Kindom of Earthly Delights to discuss the future relationship between our nations. As to be expected, many are suspicious of any ulterior motives he may have, but with Hell as an ally, nothing would stand in our way."
 DelightDiplo.7.d:0 "In an entirely unprovoked dilomatic exchange, the southern demons contacted us to make clear his violent intentions. They presented the British government with an ultimatum - to surrender ourselves within only the next few hours or to face the full vicious wrath of the Kindom of Earthly Delights. In the note, they presented detailed descriptions as to what such a conquest would look like, the things they would intend to do to our citizens, the destruction they would most certainly wage on our cities, all alongside diagrams and sketches. This is clearly an elaborate attempt to terrify us... but perhaps we would be better off avoiding war?"
 DelightDiplo.8.d:0 "In exchange for peace, the demons insist on the handover of Cornwall in the south of England. There are of course strategic reasons for them to demand this region - it could serve as a launchpad for a future invasion of the United Kingdom - but we also have strategic reasons for accepting a temporary peace at the very least. If anything, it would at least buy us time."
 DelightDiplo.9.d:0 "In exchange for peace, the demons insist on the handover of our territories on continental Europe and in north Africa, namely our holdings in the Mediterranean. There are of course strategic reasons for them to demand this region - we would be making any future naval invasions of the Italian peninsula much harder for ourselves - but we also have strategic reasons for accepting a temporary peace at the very least. If anything, it would at least buy us time."
 DelightDiplo.10.d:0 "In exchange for peace, the demons insist on our peaceful subjugation, converting the United Kingdom into a puppet state. Such an idea is abnomable, but with potential war looming, some within the government have suggested we accept the offer. As a puppet, we could avoid the most deplorable policies of Hell's regime and maintain some semblance of Great British identity."
 DelightDiplo.11.d:0 "After months of encouragement from the deplorable [VAT.GetLeader], Scottish libertines have finally risen up to demand independence. There is no doubt that, if successful, a sovereign Scotland would become a mere puppet, or a strong ally at the very least, of the Devil. Therefore, we have no choice but to stand and fight!"
 DelightDiplo.12.d:0 "Now that our glorious war for freedom has ended in victory, our southern benefactor reaches out to congratulate us and suggest the unification of our great nations. A united sodomic front, fighting in unison against the rest of the world, is certainly an attractive option, but it would be a shame to give up our sovereignty so soon after achieving it."
 DelightDiplo.13.d:0 "With freedom secured, the neighbouring [VAT.GetLeader] has suggested our vassalisation, allowing us to retain strong autonomy while uniting our governments under a single sodomic cause. It is a wonderful idea to some people, but we must proceed with caution."
 vatican.65.d:0 "We turn now to the lands of revolution, the glorious French Republic. We have both symbolic and practical reasons to consider this our next target: the uprisings that began in France from 1789 on would send shockwaves across space and time, inspiring slave revolts and civil rights movements for generations. That spirit of freedom that we so admire was sadly quashed with time, and the republic that exists today has grown lazy, fat, and top-heavy with its colonial expansion. It is long overdue that the elites of France feel the sharp sting of the 'National Razor,' that a new spirit of revolutionary action and absolute freedom be projected into the hearts of the people. This time, the revolution shall rush forwards into frightful vistas yet unimagined - territories of lust and liberty beyond restriction - and this time, it will never end."
 vatican.68.d:0 "That imposing country estate, akin to the royal palaces of some small kingdoms, had once been the shimmering holiday retreat of a fascist official. Last night, however, now in the private possession of a certain [VAT.GetLeader], was to host a ceremony of the utmost extravagence and vulgarity. Few rules were enforced, only that the guests could not maim or kill each other (naturally) and that excessive damage to the building be avoided. The wine and exotic foods flowed freely, one such fruit having been harvested from the underworld itself, inducing vivid and sensual hallucinations in whomever consumed it. Another fine liquid, bubbling like champagne, was forced upon all guests at the start of the evening, subduing the senses of everyone to the extent that none were capable of refusing any demand however outlandish or despicable. If any sober man were to the hear the music of that night in Salò, those infernal bagpipes and chaotically fluttering flutes, he would most certainly be driven to madness. The frightening [VAT.GetLeader] attended the occasion, alongside, of course, the French president who showed no small apprehension. As the evening matured, however, all doubts fell away and in time he was as much a detestable participant in the cacophony as any fork-tailed demon or seductive nymph - Your Majesty, it will please you to know that we have all of the photographs you could possibily desire."
 vatican.75.d:0 "The shining beams of the Enlightenment only touched lightly upon the peninsula of Iberia; indeed, the average citizen of those times gained little or nothing from the 'Enlightened Despotism' that the Spanish aristocracy pursued. As our Mediterranean counterpart, it is only right that we now turn to them for friendship - or perhaps something a little more forceful - and attempt to rectify the failures of the past. Our generals and diplomats have presented two key strategies, one underhanded and the other a bit more gung ho, and the final choice is now up to our glorious leader."
 vatican.76.d:0 "[SPR.GetLeader]'s long overdue visit to the former Papal palace, now the Devil's flaming sanctuary on Earth, has been met with great cheers across the land. It is good to know that we have friends in Spain - and we apologise most heartily that we had to shove him into a utility closet at the back of the Basilica, restrained by the hands and feet, stripped entirely nude at the request of the demonic [VAT.GetLeader]. We have promised that in good time, he will be relocated to a comfortable holding cell deep beneath the Earth, although this did not seem to relax him one bit. If anything, the screaming got louder. A curious fellow. Unfortunately, it was the best option and a mock version of [SPR.GetLeader], tuned by the finest clockmakers and expertly carved by Hell's greatest puppeteers, has already been sent back to Spain. It will now be its task to blend in as naturally as possible, and to work towards the sabotage of the Spanish State from the inside."
 vatican.79.d:0 "The Hellfire Clubs of Enlightenment Britain gave refuge to the most depraved of luxuries; hidden away from the prying gaze of commoners, utterly detached from the laws of the day, these elite men plumbed the depths of excess. Extreme liberty, rabid anti-deisim, and drunken violence was all the law these clubs ever knew, though sadly they dissipated one after another, chipped away by scandal and prosecution. There is potential on the British Isles for a grand hellfire resurgence, for the formation of an entire state dedicated to such depravity. To ensure our victory however, we will have to approach our enemies with no small caution."
 vatican.91.d:0 "They call it 'Neonspiral,' an architectural phenomenon blending visceral colour with organic shapes, a kind of reinvention of the forest itself, as if nature and machine merged together in some chaotic experiment gone awry. It is mere theory at this time, but our hellish architects suspect that, just as a musical piece emulates intense emotion, our towering neonspiralites shall inspire pure, animalistic frenzy in all who view them. Indeed, just as an entire orchestra moves men to tears, cities of neonspiral grandeur shall drive the races of Man into absolute and unfettered depravity. As we move beyond the realm of hypotheticals, we ask ourselves precisely what kind of emotions we wish to provoke: these towers could encourage unrelenting promiscuity, eradicating taboos of the body once and for all; they could drive our people into raging insanity, transformed into mere beasts of instinct; or they could inspire unrestricted creativity, forging entire cities of psychedelic artists, crackpot philosophers, and mad scientists."
 vatican.92.d:0 "Any foreigner would be forgiven for mistaking our hellish cities, with their rising steeples of fleshlike tones and moaning sirens ringing throughout the night, with a forest of some kind. A forest that had been driven to madness by some variant of alien disease, warping and twisting the buildings into fantastical shapes - phalic, undulating, alive and piercing deep into Man's most sacred of desires. The shrill hollers of street gatherings, naked and writhing and glistening, mould a scene of screaming degradation that can never - must never - will never - end."
 vatican.93.d:0 "The greatest lie in all of history was that Man is greater than Beast. A deception espoused by the holy man at the altar, so destructive as to disconnect us from what truly, only matters. Rage. Pain. Sharp and constant, ravenous and reasonless. The men and women of our lands only feel truly alive, their souls fulfilled with pure pleasure and meaning, when they savagely kill or are killed - as it should be. The various intellects of mankind only drive him in one direction, towards depression and angst; so it is within our Eden neverending that no man or woman shall ever think ever again."
 vatican.94.d:0 "The Christian arts, though gorgeous in their own ways, from the elegant cathedral to the holy mural hanging aloft, were primarilly a tool of conformity. Abstraction was discouraged, and to view the world through one's own twisted eyes was to blaspheme against God's objective design! God is dead, now. His carcass rots in the beating sun of our neo-enlightenment, the carrion feast and as they do, we construct our own gods everyday and everywhere. Censorship is the weapon of the coward and the tyrant, too afraid and vainglorious to face the truths of his fellow man, truths that are equal and even superior to his own."
 vatican.100.d:0 "Your Majesty; cries rang up and down the panicked streets of Paris this evening as rightful justice struck their city. As per Operation Gargantua, plumbing systems throughout the arrondissements had been sabotaged - sewage lines were blocked - canals were hastily dammed! Before most Parisians had a chance to flee, the roadways had been transformed into knee-deep streams of sludge, sloshing and stinking and bubbling from one block to the next. We estimate that in a matter of hours, thousands of homes had been irreparably destroyed, furniture now littering the soaking streets and hundreds of families rendered destitute. As we predicted, power lines in some districts have also been damaged severely, blacking out huge portions of the city. Paris, to put it simply, is reeling. Never again will any man or woman doubt your might - or your brutality. On your order, we will permit rescue teams to enter the city."
 vatican.101.d:0 "May it please Your Majesty that preparations have commenced for the construction of grand cathedrals towering higher and higher than any of the sickening Christian variety! In the style of old gothic works shall these monuments be made, and scattered all over will be the most frightfully crafted gargoyles and goblins, sneering and hollering at the congregations below. Instead of foul bells ringing by the hour, trumpets will be blown through the gargoyle's mouths - and other orifices besides - to emulate shrill cackles. Deviating from the cruciform shape of old churches, our hellfire temples will be hexagonal in arrangement, towers at each angle with flaming goblets at the top, and all in all we are talking six storeys! This includes the rancid cellars filled to bursting with liquors and ales, and grand subterranean halls where the most special of hellfire rituals shall be conducted. No cathedral would be without dance halls or feasting chambers, and every temple shall also host its own grand library containing thousands of provocative texts in every conceivable tongue! Yes, Your Majesty, the golden age of the Hellfire Club is truly yet to come."
 vatican.105.d:0 "The ecumenical councils of centuries ago, beginning with Nicaea in 325, marked a desperate attempt by the Christians of the day to determine the nature of God once and for all, to unite the Christian sphere under one, cohesive understanding of the divine. Ironically, as the heated councils went on, they did as much to clear things up as they did tear the faith apart - it culiminated dramatically in the Great Schism of 1054, dividing east and west for generations. The Son proclaimed to his flock around the world, from priests to vicars, from patriarchs to cardinals, that one grand, final council ought to be held in Rome to settle things once and for all.\n\nToday, the excitement among academic theologians and the fanatical alike has filled the city with a buzz that it surely has not seen since the days of the Roman Triumph. The conclave have gathered with haste in the glorious Sistine Chapel, eagerly awaiting the first ecumenical revelations. Under the raucous, brotherly atmosphere, however, there is a tangible tension - it will be impossible for everyone to be satisfied with the Son's answers, and some even fear that the Schism may only be widened. Regardless, it is too late to back down now, and as the Son approaches the pulpit, the cacophony of mostly elderly voices goes as silent as a monastery...\n\nA major contributor to the schism between east and west was the status of the Pope, leader of the Roman Catholic world. Catholics posit to this day that the Pope enjoys infallibility, he cannot get anything wrong, for the simple reason that he is God's representative on this Earth. It is a belief that eastern Orthodox Christians find appalling. They may have their own leaders in the form of the patriarchs, but they are just that - leaders - fallible, corruptible human beings. It is time for the Son to finally settle the confusion."
 vatican.106.d:0 "The revelations of the first day of the final ecumenical council spurred as much celebration as they did dumbfounded silence, but of course there is no pleasing everyone. Those who reject the Son's teachings shall naturally be found anathema, so none were particularly vocal about their complaints.\n\nWhen Rome converted to Christianity - once an Empire that had mercilessly killed the Son of God - it suddenly became Christianity's most powerful asset and representative. When the Imperium fell, many kingdoms went on the claim the torch of its legacy, not least the Byzantines of the east and the Holy Roman Empire of the west. Any moment now, the Son shall declare which among those two empires represented him best."
 vatican.107.d:0 "Today marks the culimination of a historic event, a council that aims to settle questions that have plagued the wisest men for centuries. The final query posed to the Son, an issue that has divided western and eastern Christians ferociously, is that of the nature of the Godhead itself.\n\nWestern Roman Catholics propose that the Trinity consists of the Father who begets the Son, and the Holy Spirit is breathed from both of them. In the east, it is vehemently argued that the Holy Spirit is breathed solely from the Father, not from the Son. To most lay people, Christians included, it would seem a shrug-worthy detail - an almost completely inconsequential feud that borders on the comical. However, Orthodox believers warn that any suggestion of the Spirit being 'Filioque' ('From the Son') would imply that the Father is not the sole source of everything, that the Trinity has in fact two sources of divinity - it borders on turning the Godhead into a pantheon!\n\nWith no hesitation, Roman Catholicism says that the Filioque allows us to distinguish between the Son and the Spirit, and that while it is not explicitly expressed in the Gospels, it is implied. This undoubtedly has the potential to erupt into chaos, and even before the Son has arrived, the chamber echoes deafeningly with anxious speculation and loud insults. The comradery of the first day is most certainly gone, but once again the hall goes silent as the Son approaches the altar to give his ultimate answer."
 vatican.111.d:0 "Your Majesty; as you well know, ever since the discovery of our saboteur in Spain, relations between our countries have been incredibly tense. Neither of us want war, and so this evening, the Spanish ambassador approached our administration with a note. An ultimatum. We must return the real Spanish leader within due course or Spain will have no choice but to declare war.\n\nThis is all very well and good, except for one small issue. We may have neglected our prisoner for perhaps a little bit too long - indeed, we had many other things to think about! We regret to inform Your Majesty that our prisoner... may be... within a manner of speaking... dead."
 vatican.112.d:0 "The Council of Rome may have cleared up a few major questions, but while we have affirmed the Orthodox faith, the patriarchs in the east remain unsatisfied. After the medieval Council of Chalcedon, the Orthodox world was split asunder - the Greek church argues to this day that Christ's humanity and divinity exist in “hypostasis”, two natures in union with each other. The Oriental churches, in contrast, remain firm that He embodies only one nature, which is divine and human at once. It surprises the Son of Man to no end how easily humankind can squabble over such things; nevertheless, the issue must be settled."
 vatican.113.d:0 "Our drift towards Orthodox Christianity in recent weeks has emboldened the Oriental Orthodox churches of north-east Africa. As political violence grows in the region, Egyptian and Sudanese Christians demand union with the Kingdom of Man, leaving Britain in a precarious position. We could approach the Empire and peacefully request the transfer of these colonies, but doing so could have serious consequences down the road." 
 vatican.116.d:0 "Our reinvigoration of the Orthodox faith has not gone unnoticed in recent months across Russia. Indeed, it has crossed the Son of Man's mind that we will need to take advantage of the Soviet Union's rich Orthodox culture if we are to overthrow the atheist regime in Moscow. One strategy to consider is an alliance with the exarch of Kyiv, the Orthodox leader in the Ukrainian SSR - Russian Orthodoxy is strongly tied into a sense of homeland, intrinsically connected with proud nationalism, and so we may make an offer to him. Align with the Son, and we will guarantee the independence of Ukraine as a glorious Orthodox state."
 vatican.118.d:0 "To align ourselves with the Russian Orthodox Church is no simple matter; the rise of the Soviets has brought with it ruin and despair for Christians all throughout the Russian homeland. In the early days of communist rule, clergy would be hunted down and arrested - many died for their faith as martyrs, others were thrown into mental institutions and the keys tossed away. Those years of terror have died down, however, and Joseph Stalin has sought the reintegration of the Orthodox Church as an apparatus for the control of the population. Truly, these are dark times for a people once so passionately devoted to the Son of Man.\n\nIn this era of tyranny, it is to be expected that the Orthodox faith has split up many times in recent years, but two denominations stand out as potential allies, both arguing that they are the true successors to the pre-revolution Russian Orthodox Church. First, the rehabilitated Russian Church under Patriarch Sergius, a man loyal to Stalin to such an extent that many believers consider him a traitor - he would counter that the faith must do what it can to survive. While Sergius' obedience to Stalin is unquestionable, his loyalty to God is greater and he may be willing to align with the Son of Man. As an insider and a powerful political figure within that evil empire, the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow would assist us by sabotaging Russian defences.\n\nThat would indeed be a controversial alliance, and perhaps we would be better off seeking the aid of First Hierarch Anastasius. When the revolution kicked off, some clergy seized the opportunity to flee Russia, taking their church with them, and establishing the “Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia.” In the minds of many believers, Anastasius is far more deserving of the title of Patriarch than any bootlicker in Moscow, and the First Hierarch would undoubtedly serve to invigorate and inspire our troops. Both options have their merits, so we will have to choose carefully, and when the time comes to take on the Stalinist regime, there can be no doubts."
 vatican.39.d:0  "The great news has just arrived at the Vatican that our attempted coup of the Turkish government has been a success! There remain small pockets of secular resistence, but the new Turkish government has finally had a chance to convene and establish itself as the rightful rulers of the state. We now have a powerful ally in the east, an ally that owes us its very existence. Plans must be made swiftly to incorporate this regime into our spehere of influence."
 vatican.120.d:0 "The Roman Catholic Church, in one shape or another, has embodied the Word of God on Earth for thousands of years, and by the grace of the Son, it shall exist for many millennia to come. Exhaustive attempts to destroy that institution have come thick and fast, from the German theologian hammering his theses to the door, to the “enlightened” freethinker scribbling spurious drivel onto the page. But the Catholics stood firm as their numbers dwindled, and now their reward has finally arrived. Not only shall the Christendom of old be restored, a shining torch of moral righteousness in a sea of sin and death, but the Son of Man intends to spread his Word to all four corners of Creation. Some would call it archaic; we would call it consistency. The truth does not compromise - that is to be the foundation of our new Eden."
 vatican.121.d:0 "The mission of our new Eden is simple: to infuse mankind with the Word of God, to make him finally free of sin and strife by following the Son's teachings and his teachings alone. Too many times in centuries past has the Son witnessed despairingly from Heaven as His holy wisdom was corrupted, abused by cynical sects desiring only wealth and power. Status and titles, expensive vestments, elaborate rituals and ringing bells; these are the things that distract us from what truly matters. The faith. The countless innocents who have been led astray shall find salvation at last, as the Church and all its elements are stripped completely until nothing remains but the singular spark of what it means to be humble - to be dignified - to be contemplative - to be Christian."
 vatican.127.d:0 "The Taoiseach wore a cheshire grin as he strode up the steps of the mighty Apostolic Palace. He couldn't help but let out a small chuckle as he approached the Son of Man and extended his hand in greeting. Quite unexpectedly, the Saviour threw both arms around the Irish statesman to warmly embrace him - this would not be the last time that De Valera would be left in stunned and stilted silence. A devout Catholic himself, the Irish prime minister was taken aback from the moment they met, bewildered by the Son's lack of pomp or pride, his quiet and casual demeanor. The meal that evening was just as unassuming, soup and plain bread, followed up by a modest course of fish.\n\nAmong their many conversations, the Son's suggestion that Ireland move towards liberalisation and social equality was met with the most resistence. Nevertheless, there is a sense, as Mr De Valera returns to his homeland a little more sullen than when he arrived, that he has learned much on this short trip. Ireland is a young nation, one where Christianity has been embedded into the very social fabric of the state. Finding a careful balance between tradition and progress will most certainly be a painful and long-winded journey, but united, the Christian world will prevail."
 vatican.128.d:0 "After the airplane had jolted to a stop, its engines softly dying, an unassuming Fiat 508 awaited the esteemed allied diplomats as they disembarked. A pokey little thing, the drive across Rome and into the Vatican complex could hardly be described as first-class – in fact, the entire state visit was a rather understated affair. The French and British governments had decided to send a joint delegation to greet the new leader of Italy, but all throughout the visit, the Son got the impression that he was being meticulously analysed more than anything else. They appeared to be fascinated with him, bewildered even, and the allied foreign diplomats were visibly uncomfortable throughout the whole trip.\n\nQuestion after question was thrown His way; an interrogation to determine precisely whether He was who He said He was. The Son gave little away. While it may have been a peculiar few days, we nevertheless get the sense that we have allies further afield – London and Paris could serve as useful friends if the time comes to fight for our Saviour. A few days following the trip, we received a flattering note that congratulated the Son on his efforts to reform Italian society, and we have formally been invited into the League of Nations as the successor to Mussolini’s regime."
 vatican.130.d:0 "A trick – a charade – plain and simply, a joke. Joseph Stalin has had no issue making clear to us what he thinks of our recent ascendency. He and many others in the Soviet Union are of the mind that the Vatican has just coordinated a massive political coup, overthrowing Mussolini to place themselves in a position of power. The Son, in Stalin’s mind, is nothing more than a figurehead and a conman, manipulating Italian Christians in order to legitimise our regime. He has refused to acknowledge the very existence of our Kingdom as a sovereign state, let alone send any diplomats, and his only correspondence has been to demand we end the “theatrics” immediately. The Son has made the decision not to respond."
 vatican.129.d:0 "So far, the führer in Germany has been the only leader of a major power to visit the Vatican in person since our glorious rise. Whether out of respect or arrogance, Hitler was keen to shake the hand of the Son in person. It was not a long visit, nor a particularly pleasant one. He wore a stupid smile the entire time, clearly unconvinced of the Son’s authenticity as the Saviour of Man, and he seemed to treat the whole thing like one big joke. He even brought along a painting of his, titled Mother Mary with the Holy Child Jesus Christ, which he claimed to have finished in 1913. The Son said little about it, though he commended the German leader on his impressive use of light. He never mentioned what he actually thought, how cold the gaze of the infant Saviour seemed as it stared out of the painting, as if nothing lived behind the eyes, only a void, a hole.\n\nThe purpose of Hitler’s visit was made clear when he finally brought up the idea of a military alliance. He was under the impression that, like our predecessor, we would be amicable to cooperation. It was made plainly clear to him that such an alliance would be inappropriate unless the National Socialist party were willing to end their crusade against the Jews. The Son reinforced the point by stating that He Himself was of Jewish heritage. That was the one and only moment during the entire trip that Hitler stopped smiling."
 vatican.131.d:0 "The most agreeable diplomatic visit so far, president of the United States Franklin Roosevelt insisted on visiting the Son in the flesh. A strong believer and follower himself, Roosevelt’s exchanges with the Son were lengthy and insightful; the two spent hours in conversation, discussing the nuances of how Christian belief could be applied to modern social issues, like poverty and healthcare.\n\nHowever, the president's visit was not merely a gesture of good Christian faith, there was a political element that required immediate attention. As the meetings went on, Roosevelt would only get more distressed, telling the Son terrible stories of violence and hate stirring at the heart of the United States. The moment of the Second Coming should have been a day of celebration for America; instead it has only contributed to worsening tensions between the myriad denominations across the continent. Baptists, Mormons, Catholics, Presbyterians, adherents of the Social Gospel, and countless others, they all claim a righteous monopoly on the truth and yet not all of them can be right. At least, that is the way some see it.\n\nWe can only hope tensions ease with time, but if they do not, the president has suggested a state visit as a solution. Perhaps hearing and seeing the Son in the flesh would remind American Christians what the Word of God is actually about - unity through faith, not hatred, which is the dominion of the Devil. We will have to think carefully before following through on his kind offer."
 vatican.132.d:0 "Our interactions with the Japanese regime have been limited and, sadly, quite cold. It began friendly enough with a delegation of the Emperor’s representatives sent to greet and negotiate with us about the status of ongoing trade deals. The conversation gradually shifted to the topic of Imperial divinity, and the Son insisted that the Emperor was not of divine heritage. He warned the delegation of the use of Shinto State ideology to indoctrinate the people, weaponising religion as a tool of nationalism. Nevertheless, the Son offered to visit Japan himself, to speak with the Emperor and perhaps come to a mutual understanding. The delegates left Italy clearly shaken, and a few days later, the Son’s request to visit was denied. We have heard nothing back since."
 vatican.133.d:0 "It has only been a few days but the Devil’s presence on Earth has clearly shaken a few feathers. France scrambled to reinforce its Alpine border almost immediately, but the full weight of the situation had not dawned on them. Not yet. When the first French delegation was sent into Italy, they had been informed that a communist rebellion of some kind had brought down Mussolini’s regime, and that the country was in a state of civil war. That delegation did not return.\n\nThe second group of diplomats, this time accompanied by an armed escort, ventured deep into the Italian countryside, finding ravaged fields and abandoned towns, flaming cars and pillars of smoke. Hell on Earth. Along the road outside Milan, they happened across a hunched woman shrieking hysterically in a ditch – as they approached, they realised that she was actually laughing like a screeching hawk, and she turned to reveal the naked body of a human female and the contorted head of an owl. She stared back at them, still laughing, then slowly skulked away into the brush.\n\nUpon finally reaching Rome, a city in disarray, they discovered that the raging fires and plumes of ash they had witnessed from a distance were not in fact the aftershocks of civil strife; they were gigantic pyres, red-hot bonfires upon which the most unruly of cardinals were tossed and burned to the delight of hooting crowds. Among the maddening congregations were the original French diplomats, their eyes now wide and watery, their skin cloaked in a thin layer of wetness, and their bodies stripped down to the nude. They hollered like monkeys and urged the newcomers to join in. Shortly thereafter, the armed delegation fled back across the border, more confused than when their journey had begun."
 vatican.134.d:0 "We have received no word of British envoys arriving to greet us – it would seem the French have convinced them otherwise. Instead, day by day, ever more British aircraft have violated our airspace as if it no longer mattered. Their scouts soar near our cities, taking pictures and observing our behaviour, as if we were not people at all, merely a freak of nature necessitating analysis and, potentially, eradication. We have also received news of an extensive military base being constructed on the island of Malta, fitted with the latest radio and radar technology, along with elaborate coastal defences. We have politely demanded they cease aerial intrusions, lest we be forced to react, and it seems to have worked. Unfortunately, construction in Malta has not, and British naval patrols in the Mediterranean have spiked in recent weeks. Our presence, to put it plainly, is not welcome."
 vatican.135.d:0 "Our communications with Adolf Hitler have been surprisingly fruitful, at least they were. Instead of sending any envoys, the führer opted to attempt radio communications with our kingdom, and eventually they got through to us. For a few weeks, our long-distance chats were quite beneficial, and it seemed that a military alliance was near. Of course, the Reich was a bit perturbed by our arrival, but they did their best, God bless them, to appear casual and collected.\n\nThat was until the frightful [VAT.GetLeader] suggested a handier way of communicating, and began appearing in the führer’s dreams at night. For some bizarre reason, the Reich immediately cut off all communication."
 vatican.136.d:0 "Out of all the world powers, it must be said that the USSR has been by far the most cordial. Our many interactions with Joseph Stalin have been fruitful to a large extent, and our beliefs overlap in many ways. We are both determined to limit, and eventually eliminate, religious organisations for a start. He does, however, seem to be under the impression that we represent nothing more than a gang of anarchists, a cult of masquerading freaks who blend devil-worship with communist ideology. If he wants to believe that, he can – or perhaps he just cannot bear the reality that Hell is real and we have brought it up to the surface. In the coming years, we see a useful, albeit unlikely, friendship blossoming between our peoples."
 vatican.137.d:0 "As we push further into German heartland, the cracks begin to show. Rumour has it that [GER.GetLeader] himself has committed suicide, a story that is not entirely a surprise to us. Ever since the invasion began, demons have nightly infested [GER.GetLeader]'s dreams, contorting them into nightmares and psychologically torturing him with visions of Hell. Overcome with terror, the man stopped sleeping - no one could avoid rest for that long, so we presume that he ordered his scientists to concoct a hyper-effective stimulant that forced him to stay awake. It is entirely possible, given the fragile minds of men, that all those sleepless nights eventually drove him to insanity. Perhaps he thought death would put an end to the torment."
 vatican.138.d:0 "Just as we had feared, our interference in British affairs has inspired an almighty reaction from the UK establishment. The emergency government that they have installed has renounced Christianity as the official state religion, and has ordered for the closure of all Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox churches. Practically overnight, clergy of all faiths have been forced into hiding, or the police, with new powers, have broken into their homes and arrested them as potential enemies of the state. Those unfortunate enough to fall under the influence of the regime's propoganda have also began attacking places of worship. The latest images from Britain show London in desolation; the headquarters of our Christian uprising, St. Paul's Cathedral, has been photgraphed wreathed in flames, bombs piercing its colossal dome and killing dozens with each explosion."
 vatican.139.d:0 "In only a matter of days, Britain has fully imploded - a constitutional crisis erupted recently whereby the ever more secular British Junta, led by King George VI, was forced to question the legitimacy of its own monarchy. In Britain, the King is head of the Church of England, and in less than a week, he and his family have gone from the infallible royals to potential traitors. Despite His Majesty's attempts to walk the line between religion and secularism, a desperate ploy to restore stability, this morning finally saw the inevitable occur. A radical republican militia has assumed control of the Junta and, to our knowledge, the King is no longer with us."
 
#AMERICAN CIVIL WAR#
vatican.140.d:0 "“... And now, the moment that we have all anticipated. Indeed, a moment that Christians throughout the centuries have awaited with bated breath. You are listening to this live from the White House where the president has just emerged alongside his esteemed and most sacred guest. Ladies and gentlemen; the president of the United States of America.”\n\nA pause - perhaps the most suspenseful pause in radio broadcasting history. Then, Mr Roosevelt began to speak, publicly welcoming the Son of Man to the US before entering into a long recount of American Christianity, its history and greatest figures. Careful to avoid any implication of the United States being a “Christian nation,” he nevertheless urged all Americans to recognise the gravity and the glory of this moment. When he finished - when the Son finally took to the podium to speak - even the chirping birds and the thrashing leaves and the sound of urban bustle seemed to fade, then vanish, into silence.\n\nThe future of America, perhaps the world, rested upon this singular moment. Any word out of place, any single denomination offended, and all hell could break loose. We now enter into a delicate period, one that far future historians shall look back on as a turning point like no other."
vatican.141.d:0 "The largest conference hall in all of Manhattan strained to fit every representative of every Christian denomination in America. The chamber shook with the clamorous chatter of thousands of men and women, one standing up after another to address the congregation, to proclaim their allegiance to God, and to greet the Son of Man personally. Pastors, priests, Protestants and Catholics, black and white, conservative and liberal. At times, even early on, raucous insults and hoots of derision could be heard. To anyone else, the prospect of uniting them all would be a nightmare, but the Son sat and listened, calm and cool. At least, that is how he carried himself - deep inside, even he was having doubts, and his mind raced with all the ways in which this could all go so very wrong.\n\nPerhaps inevitably, there were a few walkouts; heated debates over the concept of female clergy or the inerrancy of the Bible devolved swiftly into fights, occasionally even physical altercations. These were individuals who had dedicated their entire lives to a very particular brand of Christianity, but some good came out of the conference. Mainline Protestant churches, alongside a handful of liberal Catholic groups, have begun to coalesce into an alliance - the United Churches - while evengelicals are merging together in a similar fashion. Others, like the Latter-Day Saints or the Amish preachers, remain steadfast and refuse to compromise.\n\nAs the final hours of the conference pass by, as the last few speeches are given, we are left wondering whether this assembly has made things any better..."
vatican.142.d:0 "Despite our best attempts, Christians in America stubbornly refuse to see eye-to-eye. It is admirable in a way, but this has the potential to boil into something truly frightening if left uncontrolled. Evangelical Protestant churches, determined that their faith is the true and only path, have slowly merged under the banner of “His Word” - a zealous organisation of southern clergy who see sin and arrogance in the more liberally inclined mainline denominations. Their highest representatives have urged the Son of Man to speak out, to endorse “His Word” as the one and only path to salvation, but to do so would destroy any progress we have made towards Christian unity. We may still have a chance! We may still have time!"
vatican.143.d:0 "In recent weeks, the words of the right-wing radio commentator Fr. Charles Coughlin have inspired militant Catholics across the nation. At first an ardent supporter of Roosevelt's policies, Coughlin now fears that the US is veering too far left and too far away from traditional Catholic ideals. So fervent are his followers that many have assembled under the “Christian Front,” a militia whose presence grows by the day in almost every major US city.\n\nCoughlin's words may have attracted some of society's most unsavoury characters, fascists among them, but in his voice we also sense a strong devotion to the gospels and a convincing plea that, in a world where religion is ever more an afterthought, militant action may be our only option left. The Bible tells of great orators and peacemakers, but we also know of warrior-kings and heroes whose love for God manifested on the battlefield... has that time come again?"
vatican.144.d:0 "Our steady-as-she-goes approach to Christian unification has proven too slow for some cliques, particularly the Mormons in the far west who, driven by the orations of Heber J. Grant, demand our blessing. The state government of Utah has aligned with the Latter-Day Saints in recent months, and in a shock political move, the region held an unconstitutional referendum asking citizens if they support independence.\n\nTheir reasoning is simple: the United States is a dead loss, ruled by ideologically liberal and secular forces that pull the people further away from God by the day. Now that the Son has returned, the End Times have begun... naturally, Utah's sovereignty is contested and some still refuse to believe the stunt is in earnest. The civil war that we fear may be closer than anyone thought. We believed we had time. We were sure of it."
vatican.145.d:0 "In only a few days, decades worth of history has unfolded in the United States. The president has announced a state of emergency and a heightened war readiness, citizens have begun stockpiling and panicking in the streets, and the Son has heard more prayers today than in the whole of last year. States neighbouring Utah have “decided” to join the new western republic, publishing a constitution that integrates Mormonism as a central ideological pillar. In the past few days, armed members of the Christian Front have also seized key buildings throughout Detroit and Chicago, attempting a coup in the Midwest. At first, Charles Coughlin was unnerved by the events, but has swiftly come around to the opinion that a military takeover of the US is necessary.\n\nAs a supporter of the United Churches himself, Roosevelt has sought their council during the crisis. He believes that they alone, as a big-tent coalition of Protestant and Catholic liberals, can bring Christians together. It is a daring move that has driven evangelicals into an absolute frenzy. His Word, in a response to other secessionary movements, have pulled strings in the North and South Carolinian senates, and now the Carolinas have proclaimed autonomy. They will accept dominion status as long as evangelicalism is recognised as the official nationwide religion within the next day; if the US refuses their demand, the Carolinas will declare full independence. It is no longer a question of months or years, it is a matter of hours, and American historians are coming out of the woodwork to warn us that a civil war is, at this point, inevitable. We no longer have the luxury of seeking unity; we have to pick a side."
vatican.146.d:0 "... a time and date that will go down in infamy. Parts of the Midwest came under the military jurisdiction of the Christian Front over the past few days, some peacefully, others not so much. Members of His Word in Carolina have also been joined by neighbouring states in the Bible Belt, warning the president that a crusade is near.\n\nIn the past few minutes, we have received a phone call from the president himself telling us that he had no other choice. Military forces were swiftly established along the borders of seceded territories and citizens have been fleeing to safety. No one knows who pulled the first trigger - no one admits to it, at least - and really, it does not matter anymore. This is it."
vatican.147.d:0 "It has not taken long for the governor of California, Culbert Olson, to make a shocking statement (insofar as anything is shocking at this point). Following the ruling of the Californian Supreme Court that any official cooperation with the United Churches is a violation of the separation of church and state, California has proclaimed an emergency withdrawal from the union! They claim they would rejoin if secularism is restored, but the likelihood of that at this point is nil."

#CRUSADES
vatican.150.d:0 "The Orthodox struggle against Muslim conquest began as early as the 7th century, and since then, tensions between our two faiths have rarely subsided. First went Syria, at the far reaches of Byzantine control; from there, the mighty Caliphates pecked patiently and persistently for decade after decade. Damascus, Baalbek, Hama... Jerusalem... The children of Muhammad would claim that this was all in self-defence, that war was their only option in a world rife with enemies. They claim that to force religion upon another is a violation of free will, that Allah teaches against “compulsion,” and so any war declared for that purpose would in fact be a violation of the Quran.\n\nThe Son does not necessarily disagree, he assumes the best intentions in all men, but that is irrelevent now. It seems that the same “necessity” that inspired early Muslim expansion has arrived again as the Muslims reels in the shock of the Son's arrival on Earth. In only a few weeks, what appeared to be irreparable chasms between the Islamic denominations have snapped shut, Muslims across the east driven into each others' arms to defend their common way of life. Their leaders call the Son “al-Dajjāl” - the Deceiver - a charismatic tyrant said to manifest on the outset of the End Times, his only goal being to corrupt and convert as many as possible to evil.\n\nThis, of course, is not unexpected: perhaps if He had returned in Mecca or Medina instead, the tables would be turned, and Pope Pius XI would be declaring a crusade against the “Antichrist” around now. Either way, we must be prepared moving forward. The last thing we need is another Ottoman or Mughal steamroller crushing all in its wake, united and determined to defend itself by any means at hand."
vatican.151.d:0 "If anyone had predicted this time last year that, within twelve months, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan would eagerly sit together to discuss unification, the white coats would come flapping. However, a certain Soviet despot once said that “there are weeks where decades happen,” and we have just witnessed it firsthand. Drawn together by a common fear of the Son, the last documentation was signed earlier this morning to dissolve the Iraqi, Iranian, and Afghani governments, merging them into a singular unitary body: a new Persia.\n\nFor the sake of cohesion, the practice of various Muslim sects has been legalised, and a strong, militaristic police force will be established not to subjugate the people, but to intervene in any inter-denominational conflicts. While the new nation is majority Shia, efforts have been made to ensure something resembling fairness.\n\nDespite our concerns, the Son has agreed to formally recognise the state and appoint a brave ambassador within the next few days. The map is changing quickly, and rumours of Arabian unification would imply that more changes are to follow."
vatican.152.d:0 "As the rumours suggested, the Muslim states of Arabia have also been in secret negotiations over the past few weeks. Frantic to protect themselves, the new Arabian Sultanate is not a threat to us - not now, at least. Their priority at the moment is to solidify their geographical integrity, quelling minor rebellions and legitimising the new government which consists of ministers and advisors from all former nations. The House of Saud is most definitely the ringleader, though, having organised the entire transition. While Persia may be majority Shia, this new Arabia consists primarilly of Sunni Muslims, and so our silent hope is that the two states struggle to cooperate. A divided east is in our interest, and the longer they bicker with each other, the longer we have to ready ourselves for conflict."
vatican.153.d:0 "“O Holy Saviour, who spilled Your blood for us on the cross! Glory forever unto You, for when Satan tried temptation in the Garden of Gethsemane, You stood firm and loyal to Your mission of salvation. The very ground beneath Your feet, O Heavenly Son of God, sprouts flowers and grasses of many varieties, and delicate seeds that, come Spring, blossom magnificently and instantly into great, fruitful trees -”\n\nAnd it was around then that the Son rose his hand to silence the messenger boy. In His presence, many would get carried away and collapse to their knees in worship. It was always an act that He appreciated, although He routinely assured them that it was unnecessary. This time was different, however; he could see fear in the young man's eyes, and a shortness of breath that meant only one thing. It was done. Decades after the collapse of the Ottoman regime, the Islamic peoples had found the strength within themselves to set aside all differences once again, to stand side by side as allies and proclaim the Caliphate of Yawm al-Qiyāmah. The name refers to the Final Judgement set about by Allah, an indication that the Muslim world truly believes that the End Times have begun. A remarkable achievment of unity, representatives of both the Shia and Sunni creeds hold joint power within Al-Majlis al-Islām, the grand council of the state.\n\nThe Son rests a hand on the young messenger's shoulder, and instantly, the boy's exhaustion from running halfway across the city is alleviated. Then, he is assured that all will be well. These same words will bring comfort to the people of our nation in the coming days, but the fact very much remains..."
vatican.154.d:0 "Our recent focus on Turkey has not gone unnoticed by other powers in the region, and late yesterday evening saw Yawm al-Qiyāmah make their most daring move yet. With the Turkish government distracted by our posturing, and struggling to quell Christian dissent from within, the armies of Yawm al-Qiyāmah were swift to capture Kurdish lands. The operation has taken the world by utter shock, displaying a level of recklessness - or indeed fearlessness - that is enough to make the Son think twice. For such a daring incursion, there was surprisingly little bloodshed and the Kurds for their part welcomed their liberators with open arms.\n\nSuch a move could only have been possible thanks to us. Under any other circumstances, Turkey would undoubtedly be preparing for war right now; with two great powers on either side, however, each vying for the slightest opportunity to go in and take the rest, [TUR.GetLeader] has been reluctant to make any moves. This kind of tension is unsustainable, and we cannot allow Yawm al-Qiyāmah to secure any further territory."
vatican.155.d:0 "The soldiers of Byzantium have fought valiantly, but it would seem they have reached their limits under the beating sun. The element of surprise is lost; perhaps we should consider cutting our losses and hanging on to what we have already conquered."
vatican.157.d:0 "At this point it is clear to all that we and the Muslim empire are in a state of perpetual, albeit intermittently energetic, war. The declaration of a jihad ought not to be taken lightly, and it is a move that many in the Muslim world consider an act of self-preservation more than anything. Jihad - crusade - anyone can call this what they like. What matters is that we cannot back down now, and neither can they. To make a move for peace in this restless era would be to put everything we have achieved on the line."
vatican.158.d:0 "Calls for an end to the war have gone mostly ignored by our crusader commanders, leaving a lot of soldiers without any choice but to desert the ranks. Some would call it dishonourable, but the Son acknowledges the pain and suffering that conflict brings and has formally forgiven any deserters of wrongdoing. A moral choice, perhaps, but one that has encouraged even stronger cries for peace, and it is clear by now that this crusade has reached its finale."
vatican.159.d:0 "War, at its most fundemental, comes from ignorance. Ironically enough, however, it can show us all how truly similar we are. Every man bleeds, fears, longs for his home, and every nation begins to buckle if it has dedicated itself to war for too long. Today, the inevitable occured, and one of us finally snapped - a note arrived from the Islamic embassy suggesting a truce. Signed by high-ranking members of al-Majlis al-Islām, the message is brief and to the point; the sons of the Muslim world are dying, and for what? More wives of the Caliphate become widows by the day, children without fathers, a nation without a chance to move into the future, forever trapped in a fiery cycle.\n\nThe tragic words echo eerily of own predicament. Perhaps we were blinded by fear. Perhaps they were too. Come to think of it, there was never a single moment when we thought to sit down with them and simply talk. They have requested an immediate response, and we will give it to them."
vatican.160.d:0 "In only a few days, the gun shots across the Middle East have vanished and an unsettling silence has fallen over the great deserts and river valleys. There is no formal dedication of peace, not be either side, and the world is frightfully aware of this. That is what makes these negotiations so hopeful - and so treacherous. Like a captain steering his ship through uncharted waters, sharp rocks jutting up from the ocean on both sides, the Son has arrived in Baghdad to lead the negotiations. It is jarring to see how accommodating our Muslim hosts have been so far, considering the bloodshed of the past few months, but perhaps the fear of returning to that is what inspires them to show respect. In kind, the Son has shown gratitude, but smiles and handshakes can only be the start.\n\nThe really hard work takes place behind closed doors, between the delegates of our most holy kingdom and Yawm al-Qiyāmah, pitted against one another to secure the best deal possible. Our advisors are split completely on how to approach the situation, some eagerly pushing for us to finish the job on the enemy, others desperate to see not only peace but mutual cooperation between our peoples."
vatican.161.d:0 "Deliberations among the regional members of Al-Majlis al-Islām have taken many days, and we have no doubt that things got heated at times. What we demand of them is bold indeed. This morning, however, before the sun had even risen, the ambassador of Yawm al-Qiyāmah had provided to us the long-anticipated response.\n\nThe Muslim world says no to our request. A terrible outcome and one that the whole world will be shocked and disappointed to hear. Not only have peace negotiations irreparably fallen apart as a result of our obscene demands, but war in the near future seems inevitable once more. Peace has failed."
vatican.162.d:0 "Deliberations among the regional members of Al-Majlis al-Islām have taken many days, and we have no doubt that things got heated at times. What we demand of them is bold indeed. This morning, however, before the sun had even risen, the ambassador of Yawm al-Qiyāmah had provided to us the long-anticipated response.\n\nThe Muslim world accept our request. Despite the outlandishness and audacity of our behaviour during the negotiations, it would seem that it worked in our favour, injecting fear into the hearts of our Muslim neighbours. We have called for an immediate transfer of territories, to be completed within the next few days, a wonderful victory of the Son and for Christians everywhere. There are those, however, that warns us of the consequences of such demands - we have very well have lost whatever chance we had at making a lasting peace with the Islamic faith. Whatever the future holds, we will be ready for it."
vatican.163.d:0 "Despite a flurry of concerns over the igniting of a second series of wars, the negotiations in Baghdad have ended with a surprising level of mutual understanding. War now seems a distant possibility and all it took was for us to sit and discuss what brings us together, what makes these two faiths so alike in many ways. Christians and Muslims may have fundementally distinct worldviews in some respects, but the Edenic Commons and Al-Majlis al-Islām have discussed the common goals of both religions - to protect the weak, to spread love, to enforce justice, and to devote ourselves to God, whatever name or shape he may possess. Moving into the future, perhaps those core Abrahamic values can serve as the glue that binds our union together, and united, anything is possible for us."
vatican.164.d:0 "A commitment to peaceful union may be one thing, but we have to iron out the details of our future cooperation with the Islamic community. Neither of us want war for the sake of it, and so a great many Christians and Muslims attending the conference in Constantinople would argue that our alliance should be purely economic, that we should put all military endeavours behind us. A noble idea, but then again, outside forces will surely try to attack us now that, as a united body, we pose a powerful threat to the world order."
vatican.165.d:0 "In the wake of our young and unlikely friendship, Muslims across our own holdings in Africa and further afield have rejoiced. They have also, on a more uncomfortable note, requested to join Yawm al-Qiyāmah. Logically, of course, this makes sense, and Yawm al-Qiyāmah themselves have dropped the hint that they wish to unite the Muslim sphere on more than one occasion. As a sign of dedication to our alliance, perhaps we should accept?\n\nThan again, they are pushing it."
vatican.169.d:0 "While the British army has been distracted by the recent outbreak of war, evacuating troops from the Middle East to counter our aggression in the west, Muslim forces captured several key cities. Kuwait and Doha were among the first to fall, civilians rising up to assist the invading forces. We may yet win the war with Britain, but it will be at the cost of allowing Yawm al-Qiyāmah to grow fatter and stronger."
vatican.170.d:0 "Our efforts to eliminate the British threat have fueled the fire of another that looms to our east. Already an unstable corner of the British Empire, Pakistan has only seen greater unrest since the war began. A strongly Muslim region, Pakistani insurgent groups have coordinated with Yawm al-Qiyāmah in recent weeks to attempt a complete breakaway from British control, and the result has been far from pretty. While some parts of Pakistan remain in the grip of the Empire, others have broken off and united with their mighty Islamic neighbour. A thin strip of land between the two colossal countries remains in the grip of daily bombings and gunfire. We had many intentions going into this conflict, but this was not one of them."
vatican.171.d:0 "When it happened, it was executed flawlessly. It was not beyond the knowledge of the Prince of Hell that, ever since the Kingdom's foundation, a cult of personality had slowly been forming around his second-in-command, the First Woman, Lilith. Unbeknownst to men in the highest echelons of Sodomic governance, however, this cult had been quietly plotting a takeover for months. With eyes and ears everywhere, and more than ten thousand participants when the coup finally ignited late last night, it is no miracle that the thing went off without a hitch. The “Lilites” as they call themselves had clearly been orchestrating this to a level of precision and confidence never before seen on this Earth.\n\nAs the sun rises on a new Kingdom, on a land ruled by a new matriarchal order, efforts to execute prominent male officials are already underway - the Prince is no more, beheaded for all to witness in St. Peter's Square. The entire insurgency has been pursued with such speed and unrelenting cruelty that few men have had the balls, or indeed even the chance, to retaliate. It opens the way for Lilith to now exact her own vision of paradise, to construct the Eden that she believes should always have been part of God's design. It was a crime - a detestable and bloody-minded crime - for God to mould Man before Woman, and then expect the wife to submit to her husband. The days of brutish patriarchy have finally run their course."
vatican.172.d:0 "It was near enough 1 o'clock in the morning, as harsh rain pattered against the panes of the Sapienza University of Rome, and the lights fizzled and flickered, drained by the electric horror unfolding within those old walls. Since the Prince's ascendency, this university and many like it have been completely reorganised to facilitate dark and unholy experiments. Bordering on satanic ritual, black magic and fringe science merged to create the most abhorrent bastardisations of God's design.\n\nA full-scale invasion of the American homeland is not beyond our capacities, but an endeavour of that scale would be expensive and undoubtedly risky. No - the Prince had something else in mind. One yellowed eye opened, hard and pungent breaths began, and convulsive jerks in the arms and neck confirmed that the procedure, the most ambitious of its time, had been a success. The corpse of Benjamin Franklin rose from the table, quivering and confused. The Founding Father may be averse to cooperation wih the Devil at first, but he will come around. We are sure of it.\n\nIn life, Franklin may have been a great statesman but he was also a notorious freemason. The man was a good friend of Francis Dashwood, the infamous libertine and founder of the English Hellfire Club; rumours even abound that Franklin visited the Club's subterranean meeting place to participate in its unspeakable rituals... on more than one occasion.\n\nThese vices were enough to earn him a coffin of flames in the depths of Hell, but if he is wise enough to help us infiltrate the nation that he helped establish, perhaps we could organise more comfortable arrangements. A ship is prepared to send him in secret across the Atlantic, bound for the Home of the Brave; all we need now is his vow of loyalty."
vatican.173.d:0 "It took surprisingly little effort to convince Franklin in the end - a few hundred years buried alive and on fire would be enough to soften up any man. Without hesitation, the wretched walking corpse made headway for the United States and it has come to our attention, only just this morning, that Benjamin Franklin's return home has already been making waves. It was late yesterday evening, around about 7 o'clock, when the double doors of the American Senate flew open and a dreadful smell wafted into the chamber. No security, no police officer, had dared to stop Franklin as he made his way into the building - out of fear or foolish patriotic devotion, we do not know, nor care - and his magnanimous arrival left every senator in the room utterly repulsed... and then awe-struck... and then veritably ecstatic.\n\nIn only a few hours, the word has spread across the US, and cheers ring out resoundingly from sea to shining sea. It would seem that our plot has kicked off without a hitch, and the empty-headed American populace have convinced themselves that God, in his majestic mercy, has gifted the USA one of its greatest statesmen to help in combating the Devil. Poor fools. They know not that Mr. Franklin dances to our grisly tune. “Miraculous,” they call it..."
vatican.174.d:0 "In his day, the old nickname of “the First American” got attached to Benjamin Franklin, such was his dedication to pursuing a free and democratic union of states. Today, that same vigour has returned to Congress and, even without holding the position of senator or House representative, the resurrected Franklin has been accepted as an important dignitary and advisor to the president. Swiftly, a new position was created - Father of the State - specifically for him. He has already spoken many times in Congress and at the White House, addressing statespeople and the public alike. With each passing day, his approval rating skyrockets, no small thanks to his eagerness to satisfy his demonic masters, and he ingrains himself deeper into American political machinations by the hour. The plot to take America nears its final act."
vatican.176.d:0 "Fearing the Devil's wrath and the beginning of the End Times, the US House and Senate, in conjunction with the president, made a deeply radical decision. Urged on delicately by Benjamin Franklin, the government finally opted to appoint him as leader of the nation, commander-in-chief, and did so through an elaborate procedure. First, the Vice President willingly resigned; then the president appointed Franklin as the new VPOTUS; finally, late yesterday afternoon, it was officially confirmed that president himself had submited his own resignation - by law, this meant that our zombified mole was now the most powerful man in the Western hemisphere.\n\nOur celebration was short-lived. We regret that the worst has come to pass, that in a stupid lapse of judgement, President Franklin, a man who owes us his very life, has rejected Satan's plot. As explained in a short note sent by the American ambassador, the president has no intention of following our orders any longer, seeking instead the good grace and mercy of God. The bastard believes that if he proclaims holy war upon us, defeating the Devil in the battlefield and retaking the Vatican for Christianity, God will finally allow him into Heaven... we have never heard anything so misguided and pathetic."
vatican.177.d:0 "After months of hard fighting and blinding destruction, the United States has finally come under our command. A few pockets of Christian rebellion remain, but their days are numbered. By the time our forces reached the White House, the coward Franklin had already scrambled aboard an airplane destined for a bunker somewhere deep in the Arizona desert, and perhaps if he had taken off a day earlier, he would have gotten there. Luckily for us, our artillery managed to bring the aircraft down in a blazing trail of fiery glory! Never before has the clash of splintering metal sounded so good; explosions shooting high into the air, trees toppled and upturned as the wrecked hull of a flying machine smashes through them, jolting to a violent stop at the edge of a river.\n\nAnd the screams. The screams of a president, a corpse, a man who knows that all is lost and that a second hellish damnation awaits. We could have sworn that in his last scorching moments, the cretin prayed for God to save him, but the Prince is humanity's God now, and he is not so merciful or forgiving. Benjamin can expect the very best in demonic torments when he returns to that damnable flaming coffin."
vatican.179.d:0 "As we set our sights towards the colossus of the United States, we recognise that there are few Americans we can rely upon to assist us. Even among the countercultural movements and the neo-Satanic cults, we find that patriarchal supremacy remains strong. There is one small contingent of America, though, that would delight in aligning with our expansionist ambitions: the Pagan covens of New England. It is known to most that the witch trials of the Puritan days saw countless women murdered unjustly, stripped of their humanity and thrust into the flames. It was a crusade inspired by the very worst heights of the Spanish Inquisition, a repugnant assault on women’s liberties, and a shameful dismissal of the power of witchcraft.\n\nSince then, the American magical community has hurried underground, hidden in plain sight but terrified to reveal itself. Witches and sorceresses, druids and goddesses; they deserved so much more than this, and perhaps we symbolise their opportunity to finally restore their dignity – their hope return to prominence – their chance to seek their revenge. We must make haste, and remain in the shadows, as we contact each and every isolated coven, cult, and clan. Divided they are weak, but a united order of witches, the likes we have never seen, would be a potent ally indeed."
vatican.180.d:0 "Within the past few weeks alone, our attempts to contact and unite the witches of New England, a new generation of magic-wielding heroines, have been a wonderful success. While some ascetic crones and fae, lurking deep within the forests of North America, have dismissed our call to action, the younger and optimistic witch-folk have excitedly flocked to our banner. Rumours of a glorious future revolution, a grand vengeance for the horrors of Salem, have always been just that – rumours. Echoes of a dream. For the first time in generations, we have the power to make that dream a reality. The Black Circle of Boston; the Albany Coven; the Hellfire Sisters of Providence; the Salemite Club. These covens of witchcraft, great and small, north and south, have slowly congregated to form a united front against America! Now that we have the numbers and the willpower, witches from across the States flocking in droves back to New England, our strategists have begun to concoct a truly devilish rebellion. One that will shake the world."
vatican.181.d:0 "Though our magic is great indeed, there is no question that it has dwindled over the centuries, much as how witches have gradually diminished in number since the days of the burnings. For this reason, many have felt it wise to collect piles of mortal weapons, guns and ammunition, to support our violent rebellion. But the time has come, many argue, for us to make our final preparations and send the call out to all covens. With Salem as our base, the lands of New England should fall swiftly – it is the rest of the country that the witches fear. In the best case scenario, we are envisioning an America reborn, one where witches fear mortal men no longer, rather very much the opposite. One where magic becomes commonplace, and churches become temples to the most depraved of hellish rites. Where matriarchal dominance becomes the order of the day, and finally the witches of Salem are avenged!\n\nIn the worst case, the terrors of the witch trials could very well return. Our sisters would be rounded up and imprisoned, executed, or even tortured for their secrets. Secrets about magic that mortal men would no doubt wield carelessly, turning it against us in their sick lust for domination. Do not doubt it, sisters. When the call goes out, when the bell of revolution tolls, there is no turning back. We win or we die."
vatican.182.d:0 "All our grimmest fears have regrettably come to fruition. How stupid we were to think that after all these centuries of decline, of the diminishment of Pagan magic and the technological advancement of our enemies, we could defeat them in one fell swoop and usher into a new age of proud witchcraft. Day by day, frightful stories and photographs reach our shores depicting our sisters in agony, their faces contorted in horror and woe as gunfire wipes out an entire generation of witches. The bonfire flames of yesteryear have been replaced by gas and bullets, by landmines and shells, and the searing heat of those unfortunate women who burned in Salem is alive again; it burns with a passion. This was perhaps their only chance, we gave them hope, and it is gone."
vatican.183.d:0 "Some would think it a tad distasteful to burn prisoners-of-war on immense wooden bonfires, or entrapped within flaming wicker statues, but we would call it poetic justice. There is no doubt that in the decades to come, men will resist the Salemite Coven’s governance, but for now, the war is very much at an end. Who could have seen it? In only a few months, the Christian, patriarchal landscape of the United States has been torched into dust and upon those ashes has been built a new and divine order of witchcraft. The newly proclaimed Matriarchal Congress, a covenant of women wielding immense supernatural strengths, has already began the process towards a Satanic ritual-state, an empire built on hellfire and feminine power. Through blood it has been won, and through blood shall it be maintained.\n\nThe Great Justice, as some are calling it, has only just ended but the Congress of witches have already drafted preparations for mass societal and infrastructural upheaval. Before the embers of war could die, Puritan statues and Christian iconography were being stripped down and destroyed across the nation. In their place now stand idols to the martyred women who died by the hand of witchfinders. It is a rebirth we observe with pride, and anything we can do to help them shall be done."
vatican.184.d:0 "As this terrible but necessary war for liberty goes on, it becomes clear that the United States is buckling under the pressure of our Satanic supremacy. At this point, ten or so of their men die for every one of our witches, and all the technology of mortal kind cannot hope to stand against our dark magic. To our delight, president [USA.GetLeader] finally made the daring move to approach us and beg for mercy. His offer is simple, and quite attractive; sign an armistice, and our sisters may keep all the territory they have already secured. In exchange, there will be no more war, no more bloodshed, and no more cries for vengeance."
